      "Sub-event_summary": "CCA of the 2d Armored Division advanced towards high ground objectives south of St. Gilles, passing through Canisy against light opposition, bomb craters, mines, and hedgerows.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_1": "South of St. Gilles, CCA of the 2d Armored Division, with the 22d Infantry still attached, headed for its initial objective in the exploitation: the high ground five miles beyond St. Gilles, ground commanding an extensive network of roads leading into the COBRA zone from the east and south. There, at St. Samson-de-Bonfossé, le Mesnil-Herman, and Hill 183, the armor would find good defensive positions from which to halt a possible German counterattack from across the Vire River. To reach the area, CCA had to pass through Canisy, not quite two miles south of St. Gilles.",
        "Paragraph_2": "Proceeding steadily against mortar, artillery, and antitank fire interdicting the Canisy road, CCA had more difficulty with bomb craters, mine fields, and hedgerows than with the occasional enemy resistance. In late afternoon General Rose reported opposition in his zone negligible and estimated that the rear of his column would soon clear St. Gilles.<sup>[32](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn32)</sup> Rose's optimism contributed materially to General Collins' decision to continue the corps attack during the night.",
        "Paragraph_3": "Part of the reason why the opposition was negligible lay in the clearing operations of the 30th Division. Another part lay in the fact that the St. Gilles-Canisy road was the boundary separating the *LXXXIV* and II *Parachute Corps* sectors. *Panzer Lehr* was specifically responsible for the highway. The virtual destruction of *Panzer Lehr* left the road open. The 352d *Division,* manning the sector between the road and the river,",
        "Paragraph_4": "was thus continually outflanked as Rose's combat command drove down an excellent route of advance, threatened solely by occasional flanking fire.",
        "Paragraph_5": "Only as CCA neared the first buildings in Canisy was there any real resistance. At a railroad embankment north of Canisy where a bombed railway overpass had tumbled across the highway, a few Germans tried to make a stand; the combat command outflanked the position from the east and raked the defenders with enfilading fire.<sup>[33](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn33)</sup> Coincidentally, dive bombers struck Canisy and set half the town ablaze. The armor rolled through the burning town that evening."

        "Paragraph_11": "Even though General Huebner did not possess a secure pivot point at Marigny, he felt impelled to begin his exploitation on the morning of 27 July. He ordered Colonel Boudinot's CCB to initiate the westward thrust toward Coutances. In the meantime, Colonel Smith's 18th Infantry was to attack Marigny and high ground south of the town in order to secure the road network required for sustaining the exploitation.",
        "Paragraph_12": "Getting CCB on the way to Coutances conformed with the original 1st Division plan, a plan devised to employ as the axis of advance the east--west Coutances-St. Lô highway, which passes through rolling *bocage* country. West of Marigny the highway runs along the southern slope of a ridge line formed by a complex of three hills--the highest rising 580 feet--a mile or so north of the highway. This prominent terrain feature dominating the approaches to Coutances from the north and east provided an excellent natural blocking position astride the routes of withdrawal of the German forces facing the VIII Corps, and together with Coutances was the 1st Division's objective.",
        "Paragraph_13": "Of the three hills forming the ridge line, the first, five miles west of Marigny, is near Camprond. The second, two miles farther to the west, is near Cambernon. The third is near Monthuchon. To General Huebner the early capture of these hills was of double importance, for they dominated also his own route of approach to Coutances.",
        "Paragraph_14": "General Huebner had selected his attached armored command to spearhead the attack both because a rapid advance along the highway was essential for success of the COBRA scheme of maneuver and because the highway between Marigny and Coutances was excellent. CCB was to seize the first objective, Camprond, then the third objective, Monthuchon. Motorized infantry regimental combat teams of organic 1st Division troops were to follow in column. The 18th Infantry was to relieve CCB first at Camprond, then at Monthuchon. In turn, the reinforced 16th Infantry (Col. Frederick W. Gibb) was to relieve the 18th at Camprond. The reinforced 26th Infantry (Col. John F. R. Seitz) was to follow secondary roads on the left flank of the other units and seize the second objective, Cambernon. In the end, all three infantry regiments would be lined up on the three objectives to the rear of the German line.",
        "Paragraph_15": "After being relieved at Monthuchon, CCB had a further mission, which was determined by the location of Monthuchon on the north-south Périers-Coutances highway, one of the main escape routes for Germans withdrawing before VIII Corps. The combat command was to be prepared to do one of two things: if the VIII Corps had not pushed back the Germans, CCB was to attack northward toward Périers; if the Germans were trying to escape to the south, CCB was to proceed southwestward from Monthuchon to high ground a mile or so north of Coutances in order to block the three main highways leading into Coutances from the north.<sup>[37](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn37)</sup>"

Since continued German possession of Marigny denied the 1st Division an adequate road net, General Huebner withheld one regiment, the 26th, in order to reduce the hazard of traffic congestion. CCB was to secure Camprond, the first objective. Instead of following the armor, the 18th Infantry was to capture Marigny, then send a battalion to free the armor at Camprond. The 16th Infantry, instead of relieving the 18th at Camprond, was to make a wider swing to the west, echeloned to the left rear of CCB, and move all the way to the blocking positions on the highways just north of Coutances. Meanwhile, CCB was to attack and secure in turn all three hill objectives.<sup>[38](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn38)</sup>"

The *LXXXIV Corps* left had made a withdrawal along the Cotentin west coast during the night of 26 July with the intention of establishing a new main line of resistance. Yet on 27 July the contemplated positions of this line were becoming untenable even before they were established because of the VII Corps threat developing west of Marigny toward the German right (east) flank. When Hausser and Choltitz suddenly became aware that American armored columns were moving through the Marigny-St. Gilles gap, they realized that they would have to move fast to avoid encirclement from the east. There was no alternative to continuing the withdrawal along the Cotentin west coast. To insure escape from encirclement, they erected a north-south defensive line facing eastward. Units manning the line included elements of the depleted *17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division,* reluctantly withdrawing paratroopers, the *353d Division,* and small elements of the *2d SS Panzer Division.*"

Deciding they could wait no longer, Hausser and Choltitz agreed to withdraw to Coutances and hold it as the anchor point of a new line--an arc through Cambernon, Savigny, and Cerisy-la-Salle. Unfortunately for their plan, they were unaware that *Panzer Lehr* for all practical purposes no longer existed, and they were counting on *Panzer Lehr* to hold the Soulle River line at Pont-Brocard."

Advancing through terrain infested by stragglers and remnants of German units, the 26th Infantry executed what was essentially a mop-up operation. In the early evening the leading battalion turned and faced south to exert pressure",

According to the plan, the main battle was to have occurred in the triangular region formed on the Cotentin west coast between Lessay and Coutances by the highways from Lessay and Coutances to St. Lô. As the VIII Corps exerted pressure south from the Lessay-Périers road, the main exploiting force of the VII Corps was to have raced to Coutances to cut off German escape. \"Did we lose the big fish in the trap?\" a 1st Division officer asked. \"Yes, probably,\" came the reply.<sup>[55](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn55)</sup> The division had lost two big fish: the prestige of capturing Coutances and the opportunity of trapping large numbers of Germans north of the St. Lô-Coutances highway. In three days, the division had taken only 565 prisoners.<sup>[56](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn56)</sup> The bulk of the Germans, by escaping the VII Corps main effort, had slipped through the COBRA noose. As a result, the fighting shifted to the region south of the Coutances-St. Lô highway. The 1st Division had little alternative but to face south and assume the role that the VIII Corps had earlier played, the role of a pressure force."
