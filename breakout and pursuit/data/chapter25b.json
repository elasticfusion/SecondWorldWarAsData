Perhaps worse, U.S. pressure had compelled the *XLVII Panzer Corps* during the night of 8 August to pull back slightly the *2d Panzer Division's* most advanced wedge of the counterattack forces near le Mesnil-Tôve and Chérencé. Even more threatening was the attack of the 2d Armored Division against the deep southern flank of the *2d SS Panzer Division* at Barenton. Finally, the capture of le Mans and the possibility of an American attack northward to Alençon tied down the *LXXXI Corps* and prevented the *9th Panzer Division* from adding its strength to the second attempt to gain Avranches.[11](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn11)"

In this report, Kluge projected the following actions. The *Seventh Army* was to withdraw its Mortain salient that night. An attack force--composed of the *XLVII Panzer* and *LXXXI Corps* headquarters, the *1st SS, 2d,* and *116th Panzer Divisions,* two *werfer* brigades, and possibly an additional panzer division--was to assemble in the Carrouges area and prepare to attack during the early morning hours of 14 August, one day later than Kluge had originally contemplated. The attack, with three divisions abreast, was to be launched in a southeasterly direction along the Lalacelle-la Hutte axis--generally a thrust starting northwest of Alençon and cutting across the le Mans-- Alençon road.[23](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn23)"

Acknowledging the new set of circumstances that had come into being, Hitler, though reiterating his intention to attack westward to the sea (this time by way of Mayenne), admitted that \"the serious threat to the deep southern flank\" of the army group required quick action. He therefore approved Kluge's plan to have Eberbach launch an attack with an armored corps from the vicinity of Carrouges. But instead of an effort envisaged by Kluge as an attempt to destroy the American spearheads driving north toward Alençon, Hitler envisioned an attack against the deep west flank of the U.S. XV Corps, the axis of the thrust passing in a more southerly direction across the Sillé-le-Guillaume-Beaumont road. In order to disengage the necessary forces, Hitler agreed to \"a minor withdrawal of the front between Sourdeval and Mortain.\" He retained the *11th Panzer Division* in southern France as the only mobile reserve in the *Nineteenth Army* sector because Kluge assured him that it could not reach the Normandy front in time to attack near Alençon, and perhaps because he was apprehensive over the imminent Allied invasion of southern France.[24](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn24)"
