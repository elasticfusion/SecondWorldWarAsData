      "Sub-event_summary": "The 30th Division, under Maj. Gen. Leland S. Hobbs, planned to establish a bridgehead west of the Vire River to facilitate the advance on St. Lô, facing challenges from terrain and German defenses.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_1": "The battle for St. Lô west of the Vire River was the responsibility of the 30th Division. Commanded by Maj. Gen. Leland S. Hobbs, who had led the division from OMAHA Beach, the 30th Division had been in the line since 15 June and had suffered 3,934 casualties in the preceding three weeks. The troops were tired but not exhausted; they were in good spirits.",
        "Paragraph_2": "To get to St. Lô from the west, the division had to establish a bridgehead across the Vire River, then cross the Vire-Taute Canal, and finally seize the high ground overlooking the city from the west. The ground between the river and the canal was a swampy lowland that offered little cover and concealment. The canal itself was a formidable obstacle, a straight and narrow waterway with steep banks. The high ground beyond was hedgerow terrain. The Germans had fortified the positions on the high ground with strongpoints, bunkers, and wire entanglements. They had mined the river crossings and the routes leading to them. They had flooded parts of the lowland and kept the remainder saturated with water. They had registered their artillery and mortars on the obvious routes of approach to the canal.",
        "Paragraph_3": "The 30th Division plan was to make the main effort on the left (south) with the 117th Infantry (Col. Henry E. Kelly) and the 120th Infantry (Col. Hammond D. Birks). The two regiments were to cross the Vire River in column of battalions, pass through the swamp, cross the canal, and secure the high ground. The 119th Infantry (Col. Edwin M. Sutherland) was to launch a holding attack on the right to keep the Germans occupied and prevent them from shifting troops to the main effort. The 113th Cavalry Group (Col. William W. Biddle) was to attack on the left of the 117th Infantry and protect the division flank. The 105th Engineer Combat Battalion (Lt. Col. William T. Hansen) was to support the crossing, lay a treadway bridge, and construct a bridge over the canal. The 743d Tank Battalion (Lt. Col. William D. Duncan) and the 823d Tank Destroyer Battalion (Lt. Col. Richard B. Fuller) were to support the attack with direct fire. The 197th and 230th Field Artillery Battalions were to furnish close support, while the 118th and 196th Field Artillery Battalions were to interdict the crossroads at Pont-Hébert. The 110th Field Artillery Battalion was to give general support. The 30th Reconnaissance Troop was to be prepared to construct a bridge over the Vire River near Airel.",
        "Paragraph_4": "The attack was scheduled for 7 July. The 117th Infantry was to spearhead the crossing of the Vire at 0430, while the 120th Infantry opened its drive across the canal at 1345. The 119th Infantry was to launch its holding attack at 0430. The 113th Cavalry Group was to attack at 0430. The 105th Engineer Combat Battalion was to begin work on the treadway bridge at 0430. The 743d Tank Battalion was to move to firing positions at 0430. The 823d Tank Destroyer Battalion was to move to firing positions at 0430. The 197th and 230th Field Artillery Battalions were to begin firing at 0400. The 118th and 196th Field Artillery Battalions were to begin firing at 0400. The 110th Field Artillery Battalion was to begin firing at 0400. The 30th Reconnaissance Troop was to begin work on the bridge at Airel at 0430."
