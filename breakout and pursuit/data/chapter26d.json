By 14 August the Germans in the west had lost 3,630 officers, more than 151,000 enlisted men, and 3,800 *Osttruppen*--a total of almost 160,000 troops. On the surface, this compared favorably with the Allied battle casualties of approximately 180,000 by that date. The difference, however, was more than offset by the increasing number of Allied units arriving on the Continent and by the constant influx of Allied replacements. For the Germans, only 30,000 men had arrived to replace losses in the west; only 10,000 more were on their way to the front. On the basis of this alone, the German situation was hardly promising. Added to this was the increasing threat of Allied encirclement."

        "Paragraph_6": "An order from Hitler arrived in the west early on 14 August, and according to him, \"The present situation in the rear of the army group is the result of the failure of the first attack on Avranches.\" Alluding to what seemed to the Germans to be a change in the direction of the XV U.S. Corps thrust from the north to the west, Hitler advised of the \"danger that Panzer Group Eberbach, which was committed much too far to the north, will again become involved in a sterile frontal fight.\" What he wanted was an attack in Eberbach's sector, \"in the Alençon-Carrouges area,\" in order to destroy the great part of the XV U.S. Corps. The *9th* and *10th SS Panzer Divisions* and the *21st Panzer Division,* he instructed, \"can and must be employed for this purpose.\" This time the reinforced *Panzer Group Eberbach* had to be committed far enough to the south to strike the deep left flank of the enemy and thus deny him the possibility of launching a counterthrust into the right flank of the panzer group as he had done before. In order to free the three designated panzer divisions for the attack, Hitler admitted that contraction of the salient west of Flers could not be avoided. Yet he warned Kluge that as the front west of Flers was withdrawn to a shorter line, the enemy would bring strong pressure to bear against the south flank between Domfront and Alençon. The speed and the extent of the withdrawal to the shorter line near Flers, therefore, should depend on the amount of Allied pressure. Concerned also by \"anticipated landings\" on the coast of southern France (actually to take place on the following day), Hitler advised Kluge that \"destruction of the enemy near Alençon\" was the immediate *OB WEST* mission and that all further directives from Hitler would depend on the course of the battle there."

Otherwise, the Germans would probably lose the best divisions they had. Time was short--\"it is five minutes before twelve.\""

      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_30": "Whether Hitler's order could be carried out was a moot point because the situation in the southern sector on the evening of 15 August was discouraging. Furthermore, in the west the *Seventh Army* was in the process of withdrawing to a line east of Flers. The *10th SS Panzer Division* was unable to disengage, not only because of its involvement in battle near Domfront but also because it lacked fuel to move anywhere else for offensive commitment. The long *Panzer Group Eberbach* front from Briouze through Rânes and Ecouché to east of Argentan, with the *1st SS, 2d,* and *116th Panzer Divisions* on line facing south, was being hammered. Though the Rânes, Carrouges, and Ecouché areas seemed to the Allies to be \"crawling\" with Germans, the fact was that the *LVIII Panzer Corps* was being squeezed and this in turn was endangering the *LXXXIV Corps.* Of the two panzer divisions earmarked for Eberbach's attack, the *2d SS* was in assembly area northeast of Argentan and ready for employment, but the *9th SS,* delayed in its relief by a shortage of gasoline, was still west of the Orne River. Not much could be expected from the *LXXXI Corps,* which held its overextended sector with an equivalent of about two divisions--the newly arrived *331st Division* and a regimental-sized kampfgruppe of the *6th Parachute Division* on the right from Gacé to Verneuil, remnants of the *352d Division* with some security elements attached on the left from Dreux to Chartres. An improvised kampfgruppe under a Captain Wahl covered the twenty-mile gap in the middle--two understrength battalions of the *2d SS Panzer Division* and twenty Panther tanks of the *9th SS Panzer Division,* which had been moving behind the front toward the east before being intercepted by the *331st Division* and put to use by the corps. Despite these discouraging conditions, Jodl, who telephoned shortly before midnight to inquire about Kluge's whereabouts, held the opinion that no matter how bad the situation seemed, it was necessary to attack to the east to broaden the open end of the pocket--\"because it is impossible to get two armies out the end of an intestine.\""

He felt that scanty POL supplies were a \"decisive\" factor. He was discouraged by the \"increasingly critical\" south flank. He therefore recommended immediate evacuation of the western salient through the still existing Argentan-Falaise gap.

Presumably it would give Kluge full freedom of action. Since Jodl had agreed that withdrawal was necessary, Kluge directed Speidel to prepare immediately the draft of a withdrawal order for *Seventh Army.* The *Seventh Army* was to begin withdrawing on the following morning. Hausser was to pull two divisions out of the front at once and dispatch them to the *Fifth Panzer Army,* which had lost two divisions in two days of fierce combat. The *II SS Panzer Corps* headquarters was to be made subordinate to *Panzer Group Eberbach* so that Eberbach could exercise better control over the many splinter units assigned to him. How to get the *Seventh Army* back across the Orne was the most troublesome problem of the withdrawal. The movement of supplies westward into the pocket was already virtually impossible. Tanks were being abandoned for lack of fuel. The bridges over the Orne were not suitable for heavy traffic. Because antiaircraft protection was generally inadequate, Allied air attacks on massed vehicles at the Orne River crossing sites could create insurmountable difficulties. For these reasons it was necessary to provide for the strict regulation of traffic during the withdrawal. The *Seventh Army* was to be charged with this job. Since the most difficult part of the withdrawal would be across the Orne River itself, Kluge wanted a corps headquarters that had no other assignment to take charge of traffic control over the Orne; he designated the *LVIII Panzer Corps* for the task."

Yet Hitler and Jodl both refused to accept this hard fact despite irrefutable evidence presented by the commanders in the field.
