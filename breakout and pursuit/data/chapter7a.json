        "Paragraph_1": "In the first week of July the Allies had command of the air, their ground build-up was proceeding favorably, and enemy reinforcements moving toward the front were being delayed. General Eisenhower nevertheless was highly conscious of the unfulfilled need for greater maneuver room, additional ports and airfield sites, and open country \"where our present superiority can be used.\" Troubled by the \"slow and laborious\" advance of the First Army in the Cotentin--due, he realized, to terrain and weather conditions as much as to enemy resistance--he was worried more by the shallowness of the British sector, where one of the invasion beaches, a reception point for supplies and personnel coming from England, was still under enemy fire. He questioned whether General Montgomery, in his professed zeal to attract enemy forces to his front and away from the American sector, was making sufficient effort to expand the British part of the beachhead. \"We must use all possible energy in a determined effort,\" General Eisenhower wrote Montgomery, \"to prevent a stalemate\" and to insure against \"fighting a major defensive battle with the slight depth we now have\" on the Continent.",
        "Paragraph_2": "\"I am, myself, quite happy about the situation,\" General Montgomery replied. He had maintained Allied initiative, prevented reverses, and set into motion \"a very definite plan.\" Three needs determined Montgomery's operations--the Breton ports, space for maneuver, and destruction of German forces. \"Of one thing you can be quite sure,\" General Montgomery promised; \"there will be no stalemate.\""

Bomb line set at 6,000 yards ahead, targeting northern outskirts of Caen to destroy positions, cut supplies, demoralize enemy, and boost morale.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_3": "While the Americans were struggling in the Cotentin, the British had mounted another effort against Caen. Because in earlier attempts to take the city the British had been unable to mass sufficient artillery to destroy the strong defenses, the planners discussed the use of heavy bombers to deliver preparatory fire for the ground action. In February and March 1944 heavy bombers had launched attacks at Cassino in Italy to assist ground troops, but without notable success, and during June heavy bombers had rendered occasional close support in France by attacking targets that the chief of the RAF Bomber Command sarcastically termed of \"immediate and fleeting importance.\"",
        "Paragraph_4": "But there had been no large-scale use of heavy bombers in direct support of the ground troops. Use of bombers in a direct support role hinged upon the answer to two major questions: Was it justifiable to divert heavy bombers from their main strategic role? Could the planes bomb close enough to the forward line to facilitate the ground advance without unduly exposing the troops to the hazards of accidental bomb spillage and inaccurate aim? General Eisenhower resolved the first question. He favored using strategic air for tactical ends whenever those ends were important and profitable. Caen, he believed, was important and profitable.",
        "Paragraph_5": "Ground and air planning staffs worked out a solution to the second question. A bomb line 6,000 yards (about three and a half miles) ahead of the leading units, they decided, would minimize the danger to friendly ground troops. For the July attack on Caen, heavy bombers were to saturate a rectangular target, 4,000 by 1,500 yards, on the northern outskirts of the city. The purpose was to destroy both infantry and artillery positions, cut off forward troops from supply, demoralize enemy soldiers in and out of the target zone, and, finally, boost British ground force morale. Field artillery was to cover the gap between the British line and the air target with normal preparation fires."

Widespread debris and tremendous craters further obstructed a rapid ground advance.",
        "Paragraph_7": "The full force of the air bombardment had struck the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division, recently arrived in Normandy from the Pas-de-Calais to replace an armored division in the Panzer Group West line. With one regiment of the 16th destroyed and quickly overrun, Eberbach committed without result the powerful 21st Panzer Division, which had just been moved out of the line and into reserve. The attack of the 21st \"did not have much point,\" according to Rommel, \"because of the strong enemy artillery fire.\" The air bombardment had also fallen on the excellent 12th SS Panzer Division, still not relieved from front-line defensive duty as had been hoped. Though some strongpoints in this unit's main line of resistance held until burned out by flame-throwing British tanks, the division eventually was forced to give way."
