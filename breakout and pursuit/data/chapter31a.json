      "Event": "Allied Strategic Planning Framework Post-Seine Crossing",
      "Sub-event": "SHAEF Planners' Recommendations for Advance to the Ruhr",
      "Sub-event_summary": "Following the decision to cross the Seine on 19 August, planners evaluated routes to the Ruhr, eliminating Flanders and Ardennes due to terrain. Recommended a broad front with main effort northeast through Liège for logistical advantages, including ports, airfields, and V-weapon sites; subsidiary thrust through Metz.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_1": "The implications of the essentially simple decision on 19 August to cross the Seine were far reaching. Once across the Seine, the Allies would be heading toward the Rhine River and Germany. Where they were to make their main effort and how far they were to go occasioned much debate.",
        "Paragraph_2": "The basic directive of the Combined Chiefs of Staff governing Allied operations in western Europe pointed the Allies merely to \"[the heart of Germany](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/../../ETO/Overlord/Overlord-CCS-Dir.html).\" The Combined Chiefs had very likely chosen such a vague objective in the expectation that changing circumstances would offer the Supreme Commander a variety of goals. The Allied strategic planners perceived Berlin as the most significant political objective, but they were also conscious of its great distance from Europe's western shore. Closer and within striking distance from France was the Ruhr, the heart that pumped industrial lifeblood to the German military forces, the goal selected by SHAEF planners as the most practical for Post-OVERLORD operations. An Allied attack on the Ruhr would compel the Germans to commit a considerable number of forces in its defense, thus enabling the Allies to close with and destroy a sizable part of the hostile army.",
        "Paragraph_3": "There were four routes from northern France to the Ruhr: by way of the flat-lands of easily flooded Flanders; via Amiens, Maubeuge, and Liège along the northern edge of the Ardennes; through the hilly woodland of the Ardennes; and, less direct, south of the Ardennes through Metz, the Saar, and Frankfurt. Having eliminated Flanders and the Ardennes on the basis of terrain considerations, the planners recommended that the Allies advance north and south of the Ardennes with mutually supporting forces on a broad front oriented on Liège and on Metz. Initially, they had ruled out this dual concept because of the disadvantages of maintaining forces on two widely separated lines of communication, but they came to believe that success would force the Germans to withdraw in both areas, thus permitting adequate lateral communication.",
        "Paragraph_4": "Of the two recommended axes--northeast from the lower Seine through Liège, and east from the upper Seine through Metz--the planners indicated that the main effort should be made northeastward along the direct route to the Ruhr. Historically the most traveled invasion road between France and Germany, the route offered the most advantages: the best facilities for military traffic, a left flank protected by the sea, the Channel ports of Antwerp and Rotterdam, excellent airfield sites, a combat zone within range of light and medium bombers",
        "Paragraph_5": "*--657--* <a id=\"page658\"></a> * * * > based in England, liberation of Belgium and part of the Netherlands, and seizure of the V-weapon launching sites."

To support the drive, General Eisenhower proposed to reinforce the 21 Army Group with the First Allied Airborne Army (activated on 2 August under the command of Lt. Gen. Lewis H. Brereton) and perhaps also with a \"minimum\" of U.S. ground units.

This steamroller, in Montgomery's estimation, should move northeast from the Seine to clear the Channel coast, the Pas-de-Calais, and west Flanders, and also to secure Antwerp. The initial objectives would be the destruction of German forces on the coast, the establishment of air bases in Belgium, the seizure of the V-weapon sites, and the opening of ports. Montgomery had not yet discussed his conception with Eisenhower, but he did so with Bradley, who, according to Montgomery, seemed impressed with the cogency of Montgomery's thought.<sup>[3](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn31.html#fn3)</sup>",

As before, the 21 Army Group (reinforced by the Allied airborne army and other units) was to go northeast from the Seine toward the Ruhr in the main effort north of the Ardennes, and the 12th Army Group was to go eastward in a subsidiary drive. But now, despite a general orientation eastward south of the Ardennes, the 12th Army Group, he thought, might shift its direction of advance from east to northeast toward the coastal region and Belgium and the Netherlands if it became necessary to bolster the main thrust.<sup>[6](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn31.html#fn6)</sup>",

Despite General Bradley's feeling that a corps would be sufficient and General Eisenhower's belief that Montgomery was being overly cautious, the Supreme Commander acceded. Instead of driving eastward to pass south of the Ardennes, General Hodges was to go northeast from the Seine--north of the Ardennes--in support of the 21 Army Group. General Eisenhower then allocated the bulk of the 12th Army Group stocks of gasoline to Hodges, thereby depriving Patton of adequate supplies for a long strike toward the Saar. Since the more important objectives lay to the northeast--the V-weapon sites, airfields, the Channel ports, and the Ruhr--the subsidiary effort was curtailed. Yet since Patton had about a week's supply of fuel on hand, he would be able to initiate an advance beyond the Seine. \"I cannot tell you,\" Eisenhower wrote Marshall, \"how anxious I am to get the forces accumulated for starting the thrust east from Paris.

He was also uncomfortably aware that British logistical deficiencies dictated a reduction in combat forces for the initial drive east of the Seine. With limited forces, Montgomery had limited his sights. His primary concern was to destroy the *Fifteenth Army,* the last uncommitted German force in France and Belgium, by pinning that army against the Schelde estuary.

Hitler and Jodl had been concerned with rearward lines of defense since the end of July, and at the beginning of August the military governor of France, Kitzinger, had been charged with responsibility, under OKW, for erecting field fortifications along the Somme, Marne, and Saône Rivers to the Jura Mountains of the Franco-Swiss border. With the Seine River forming a potential outpost line and the terrain around Amiens-Compiègne-Soissons sector forming the center of the Kitzinger line, the Germans hoped to stabilize a withdrawing front far west of Germany.<sup>[17](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn31.html#fn17)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_22": "Unequivocal German withdrawal in the west had begun on 16 August in three separate movements. *Army Group B* comprised the main body, with fourteen battered infantry divisions, nine fresh but incompletely trained divisions along the Channel coast in reserve, the remnants of fourteen divisions released from the Normandy front for rehabilitation, and nine mangled armored divisions providing a sort of cavalry screen. *Army Group G* was withdrawing five divisions of the *Nineteenth Army* northward up the Rhône River valley in a rapid but orderly movement. Its *LXIV Corps,* with two divisions encumbered by noncombatants, was retiring from southwest France through a hostile country infested with FFI guerrilla",
        "Paragraph_23": "*--661--* <a id=\"page662\"></a> * * * > bands. All three groups headed for the Kitzinger line.<sup>[18](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn31.html#fn18)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_24": "Work on the line did not progress far. Kitzinger did not have enough engineer units to supervise the preparation of tank obstacles, mine fields, and the like. Organization Todt, which had been ordered to stop construction on the Atlantic Wall--except at the V-weapon sites--in order to work for Kitzinger, was slow in responding and short of materiel and equipment; even under optimum conditions it could not have furnished enough workers to build a defensive position of the proper length and depth in the time required. Impressed civilian labor did little good, for unlike the Germans in East Prussia, who willingly dug trenches to try to stop the Russians, the French in France were hardly enthusiastic about working at a task that would only postpone their own liberation.<sup>[19](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn31.html#fn19)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_25": "Warned on 22 August that the Kitzinger line seemed hardly begun, Jodl consulted with Hitler and on the following day placed Kitzinger under *Army Group B* control. Putting Model in charge of the construction had little effect--it was already too late. The Seine River line had already been breached at Mantes-Gassicourt, and heavy American pressure on the approaches to several crossing sites along the Seine indicated that the Seine River position concept might soon, perhaps in a matter of hours, be hopelessly compromised. This meant that time for building up the Somme-Marne defense line, roughly seventy miles from the Seine, was extremely short. Even though Model assured Jodl on 28 August that he was getting nearby French civilians to do nothing but dig, dig, dig, he did not believe it possible to stop the Allies short of the western approaches to the Rhine River. Only on German soil could the German Army count on civilians to help construct effective fortifications.<sup>[20](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn31.html#fn20)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_26": "Model needed troops, and he asked for fifteen additional divisions in the Troyes, Dijon, and Jura Mountains area; four army headquarters, twelve corps headquarters, thirty or thirty-five divisions for front-line duty, plus a panzer army, four panzer corps, and twelve panzer divisions as a mobile hard-hitting reserve for the Kitzinger line. With these, he thought he could meet with some degree of equality the fifty Allied divisions that he expected to be facing on 1 September.<sup>[21](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn31.html#fn21)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_27": "Though Hitler had been making arrangements to get new units to the west, he hardly could fulfill Model's request. In mid-July Hitler had ordered approximately one hundred fortress battalions, then being used in rear areas, to be transformed into replacement battalions for the front, and of these approximately eighty would eventually reach the west. In mid-August he had ordered twenty-five *Volks Grenadier* divisions organized in Germany as a general reserve, and four became available for the west almost immediately. The *3d* and *15th Panzer Grenadier Divisions,* experienced troops,",
        "Paragraph_28": "*--662--* <a id=\"page663\"></a> * * * > were traveling from Italy for commitment in France. Two \"shadow divisions\" (filler troops trained to restore veteran units reduced to cadre strength) and two panzer brigades (tank-infantry task forces designed to defend critical positions) were also slated for *OB WEST.* These forces would not become available until the end of August or early September, nor would they give Model his desired strength. Meanwhile, the front was disintegrating.<sup>[22](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn31.html#fn22)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_29": "Logistical matters seemed somewhat less discouraging. The difficulties of transporting supplies to the front in July and early August had diminished as distances shrank--the reverse of the Allied situation. Summertime had provided the Germans with insufficient hours of darkness for supply movements to the Normandy coast, and their railroad trains and motor convoys, forced to travel in daylight, had attracted Allied fighter-bombers. Wrecked and plundered trucks, wagons, and freight cars littering the countryside attested to the extent of losses. The Germans had attempted to ameliorate the situation by assigning mobile *Flak* units to guard railroads and highways. Barges on the Seine had supplemented overland traffic. As the front withdrew eastward, though the problems were by no means solved, the combat troops came closer to three supply complexes that had been established on 25 July just east of the Meuse River--one in Luxembourg near Arlon, another in the Nancy and Toul area, and the third around Belfort.<sup>[23](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn31.html#fn23)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_30": "The location of the supply bases appeared fortunate. With the Kitzinger line practically invalidated by the speed of the Allied advance and by its incomplete state of construction, the Germans looked toward the next natural rearward obstacle that might halt the Allied drive toward Germany. The Schelde estuary, the Albert Canal, and the Meuse River formed a continuous water line. Perhaps the armies could make a successful stand there.<sup>[24](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn31.html#fn24)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_31": "Since 21 August *LVIII Panzer Corps* had supervised the rehabilitation of the *Fifth Panzer* and *Seventh Armies'* fragmentary panzer divisions in \"refreshing areas\" immediately east of the Seine, but Model soon realized that \"a smooth and efficient refreshing of the divisions was out of the question.\" He ordered the panzer divisions to move behind the Somme and the Marne. With the Seine River crossings intolerably congested by 25 August, he instructed the *Seventh Army*--commanded by Eberbach after Hausser was wounded in the Argentan-Falaise pocket--to reconstitute its divisions behind the Somme also, while the *Fifth Panzer Army,* commanded by Dietrich, was to cover the withdrawal. Whether the troops could get back to the Somme before the Allies arrived was a matter of grave conjecture. The *First Army* forces along the upper Seine were so few that whether or not they reached the Marne was really of little importance. By 29 August Model frankly admitted that the Allies had \"attained absolute tactical superiority\" in both mobility and weapons, and he judged them capable of sweeping through the still uncompleted Kitzinger line and",
        "Paragraph_32": "*--663--* <a id=\"page664\"></a> * * * > destroying the German military forces in the west.<sup>[25](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn31.html#fn25)</sup>"
