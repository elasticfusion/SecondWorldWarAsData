      "Sub-event_summary": "Following the capture of St. Lô, the British Second Army launched Operation GOODWOOD to achieve a breakthrough, conceived from a conference where Montgomery advised Bradley and Dempsey suggested a strong British attack.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_17": "As a hush fell over the American front after the capture of St. Lô, intense activity began in the British sector. The Second Army launched a strong attack (GOODWOOD) that promised the Allies an excellent chance of achieving a breakthrough. Had it succeeded, COBRA would probably have been unnecessary.",
        "Paragraph_18": "GOODWOOD had grown indirectly out of the situation on the American front. At a conference on 10 July General Bradley had admitted to General Montgomery that he was discouraged about the offensive in the Cotentin and that he was thinking of the new COBRA idea, not yet completely formulated. General Montgomery had advised him to \"take all the time he needed\" in the Cotentin. To assist, the British would continue the basic Montgomery pattern of action: attempt to draw the German strength away from the American sector, hold the eastern part of the front firmly, keep the enemy forces opposite the British engaged and off balance by limited objective attacks. Immediately after the conference General Dempsey, the commander of the Second British Army, suggested that the British might take a more positive role in the campaign and launch a strong attack of their own. Montgomery's first reaction was negative, but on reflection he ordered planning started that same day. He alerted Dempsey to hold a corps of three armored divisions in reserve for a \"massive stroke\" east of the Orne River from Caen to Falaise. By 13 July three armored divisions were ready under control of the British 8 Corps."

      "Sub-event_summary": "Montgomery directed a balanced attack to destroy German forces, envisioning double breakthroughs with GOODWOOD and COBRA, involving three corps with main effort by 8 Corps towards Falaise.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_19": "Loath to abandon the idea that the eastern flank was \"a bastion\" on which not only the U.S. main effort but also the whole future of the European campaign depended, General Montgomery directed Dempsey to maintain balance and a firm base by continuing to exert pressure and destroying German equipment and personnel.",
        "Paragraph_20": "Nevertheless, Montgomery found the idea of a British breakthrough attempt increasingly intriguing. He began to think in terms of possibly making a double breakthrough effort--attacks by both British and American troops. By launching GOODWOOD the British would throw a left hook at the Germans; by following quickly with COBRA the Americans would strike with a right cross. Whether the primary intention of GOODWOOD was to aid COBRA by forcing the Germans to engage their mobile reserves and the secondary intention to achieve a breakthrough, or whether the reverse was true--though perhaps unimportant in the final analysis and perhaps even unknown to General Montgomery at the time--later became a matter of doubt and controversy.",
        "Paragraph_21": "Like COBRA, GOODWOOD was to have heavy air support. Because the air forces could not support the two attacks simultaneously in the strength desired, GOODWOOD and COBRA were to take place two days apart. Though General Bradley had originally set 18 July as the COBRA target date, the slow advance in the Cotentin caused him to postpone it one day. General Montgomery selected 17 July for GOODWOOD, but adverse weather conditions and the need for extensive regrouping forced a delay. As finally decided, GOODWOOD was to take place on 18 July, COBRA three days later.",
        "Paragraph_22": "The two major deficiencies of the air bombardment launched earlier at Caen were to be corrected for GOODWOOD. Only fighter-bombers were to attack in the zone where armored divisions were to make the main effort, and thus the extensive cratering that had had slowed armor at Caen would be avoided. The ground troops were to attack immediately after the air strike in order to capitalize on the paralyzing effect of the bombardment on the Germans.",
        "Paragraph_23": "The ground attack was to involve three corps. On the left (east), from a small bridgehead east of the Orne and northeast of Caen, the 8 Corps was to send three armored divisions in the direction of Falaise in the main effort. In the center, the Canadian 2d Corps was to secure the southern half of Caen (that part of the city beyond the Orne River) and nearby high ground. The British 12 Corps on the right was to launch preliminary attacks several days ahead of the actual GOODWOOD effort to create a diversion.",
        "Paragraph_24": "The immediate objective of GOODWOOD was the plain southeast of Caen, rolling terrain rising toward Falaise. Though neither Montgomery nor Dempsey mentioned Falaise specifically in their orders, they and other commanders were thinking of Falaise and even of Argentan as objectives perhaps quickly attainable if the battle developed favorably."

        "Paragraph_28": "Before the bombers came, a quiet had pervaded most of the Panzer Group West front since 9 July. Under the control of four corps, eight divisions had manned the 70-mile defensive line, and five divisions had been in reserve. Of the thirteen divisions that comprised Panzer Group West, a single division had held twenty miles of marshy coast land on the east flank; two divisions had guarded fifteen miles of bocage on the west flank; and ten divisions--five in the line and five in reserve--had covered the critical Caen sector of about thirty-five miles in the center.",
        "Paragraph_29": "To protect the open country around Caen, Eberbach, the commander of Panzer Group West, had established a zone defense composed of infantry positions echeloned in depth and covered by antitank fire. The main battle positions, about 1,200 yards deep, consisted of three lines, while local reserves had organized another defensive line about a mile to the rear. Dual-purpose 88-mm. guns of the III Flak Corps, ample artillery pieces, and a rocket launcher brigade in each corps sector supported the infantry positions. Behind the support weapons, four of the reserve divisions had been assembled from two to seven miles in the rear; the fifth reserve division, the 12th SS Panzer, was undergoing rehabilitation farther to the rear.",
        "Paragraph_30": "Principally from prisoner of war interrogations, Eberbach had learned that Montgomery was planning a three-pronged attack from Caen.",
        "Paragraph_31": "Accepting Eberbach's expectation as valid and respecting Montgomery's large number of divisions in reserve, Kluge had dared not weaken the Panzer Group West defenses. No further withdrawal from the Caen region seemed possible without inviting disaster.",
        "Paragraph_32": "Although Kluge had not wished to disturb Eberbach's zone defense around Caen, Hitler was not so reluctant. Signs and portents, the Allied deception plan, and weather conditions had convinced the Fuehrer that the Allies were about to make another continental landing near the Seine Bay. The presence of Allied vessels to support GOODWOOD by naval fire added to the conviction. Despite agreement by Kluge and Rommel that they had not seen anything to justify suspicion of another Allied landing and despite their \"discomfort\" with the Coutances-St. Lô sector, they were forced by Hitler's thinking to consider sending a panzer division from the Caen front to Lisieux, not far from the Seine Bay.",
        "Paragraph_33": "Before actually dispatching a division toward the Seine Bay, Kluge protested to higher headquarters. He asked General der Artillerie Walter Warlimont, Jodl's assistant, what made Hitler insist on sending mobile troops to Lisieux. \"The expectation that in the next couple of days, because of weather conditions . . . ,\" Warlimont began. \"Oh, the usual reports,\" Kluge interrupted. \". . . another landing can be made that will put pressure on the weakly held coastal front,\" Warlimont concluded. Well, Kluge said, he felt that the Allies were more dangerous in the area where they already were. \"We aren't strong enough there,\" he said. And since he did not have enough troops to cover adequately his entire area of responsibility, he preferred to take his chances where the Allies had not yet appeared. Thus, as to sending troops to Lisieux, he told Warlimont, \"I don't like what you say.\" \"I'll transmit your opinion to the Fuehrer,\" Warlimont suggested. \"Never mind,\" Kluge said hastily. \"You don't have to tell him anything more. I just wanted to talk it over with you.\" Still trying to make it clear to Warlimont that he wasn't pleased by the shift at all, he nevertheless agreed to move the 12th SS Panzer Division to Lisieux.",
        "Paragraph_34": "The weakest division in the Panzer Group West sector, the 12th SS Panzer Division had started to move to Lisieux when recalled to meet the threat of GOODWOOD.",
        "Paragraph_35": "The SS armored division was recalled partly because Eberbach no longer had a strong reserve. Since the night of 15 July, the British had attacked on the 12 Corps front using flame-throwing tanks and artificial moonlight, which was created by pointing searchlights at the overcast sky. The limited objective attacks, designed to mask the main effort to be launched on 18 July, forced the II SS Panzer Corps and part of the XLVII Panzer Corps to pull back slightly. Not only did the corps have to commit their local reserves, Eberbach had to commit two of his reserve divisions. If the 12th SS Panzer Division completed the move to Lisieux, Eberbach would have only two divisions left in reserve."

        "Paragraph_26": "Promising General Eisenhower that his \"whole eastern flank\" would \"burst into flames,\" General Montgomery requested the \"whole weight of air power\" to bring about a \"decisive\" victory. General Eisenhower was enthusiastic, \"pepped up concerning the promise of this plan,\" which he termed a brilliant stroke calculated to knock loose the shackles that bound the Allies in Normandy. Air Chief Marshal Tedder assured Montgomery that the air forces would be \"full out\" to support the \"far-reaching and decisive plan.\"",
        "Paragraph_27": "While British naval units fired from the Seine Bay in support, bombers in the largest concentration yet utilized in direct support of a single ground attack loosed their explosives near Caen at daylight, 18 July. Almost 1,700 planes of the RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. Eighth Air Force, plus almost 400 medium and fighter-bombers of the U.S. Ninth Air Force, dropped more than 8,000 tons of bombs to open a path for British ground forces.",
        "Paragraph_36": "On the British side, the 8 Corps of the Second British Army, eventually employing three armored divisions, closely followed the air bombardment of 18 July and advanced over three miles in little more than an hour. Tactical surprise and the effect of the bombardment were responsible. Eberbach had not expected Montgomery, who had a reputation for caution, to make a major attack out of the narrow bridgehead he possessed east of the Orne. Even after the attack got under way, Eberbach could not really believe that it was the British main effort. Montgomery had achieved surprise by moving his assault divisions across the Orne only a few hours before the jump-off. With German troops destroyed or dazed by the bombardment, the divisions manning defensive positions in the bombed corridor were momentarily paralyzed. Despite valiant efforts to reorganize, they were unable to offer real resistance to the British armored attack.",
        "Paragraph_37": "From about 0900 to noon, the 8 Corps was on the verge of achieving a clean penetration. Only when the British hit the enemy's antitank and flak guns on the last defensive line was the advance halted. The heavy antitank screen and the efforts of individual German gun crews and bazooka teams contributed greatly to delaying an immediate exploitation of the potential breakthrough. More important perhaps, the congested battlefield prevented rapid British maneuver, restricted approaches through British mine fields hindered follow-up forces, and subordinate commanders were hesitant to bypass defended villages.",
        "Paragraph_38": "Recovering from the surprise by noon, Eberbach mobilized and committed four tank battalions and four infantry battalions of the 1st SS and 21st Panzer Divisions in a counterattack, which dispelled British hope of further immediate penetration.",
        "Paragraph_39": "Despite Eberbach's ability to block a clean penetration, his counterattack failed to regain the lost ground, primarily because German tanks moving forward to counterattack \"sank into a field of craters and had to be pulled out by tractors.\" With all of Eberbach's forces committed and with the 12th SS Panzer Division, which had turned back from Lisieux, hardly sufficient to affect the situation, Kluge requested and received permission to bring the 116th Panzer Division from the Fifteenth Army sector across the Seine River. \"We have to get tanks,\" Kluge insisted. \"We have to let higher headquarters know without misunderstanding that we must have more tanks.\""

        "Paragraph_44": "While the Germans, despite discouragement, were content that they had fought as well as they could, the Allies were far from happy. General Eisenhower had expected a drive across the Orne from Caen and an exploitation toward the Seine Basin and Paris.",

On the afternoon of 18 July, the first day of the attack, General Montgomery had been \"very well satisfied\" to have caught the enemy off balance.
