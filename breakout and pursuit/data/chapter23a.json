The difference between the rates of progress of the two armies was easily explained. Whereas Patton's units were slashing through areas held by few German defenders, the First Army was meeting organized, stubborn resistance. Because the Third Army's achievements were more impressive, they became the side of the coin usually displayed, but the accomplishments of Hodges' First Army were no less important in determining the course of the campaign in western Europe."

In keeping with this concept, the boundary between the First Army and the British and Canadians extended from the invasion coast southeast more than fifty miles through Bayeux and Flers, then east through Alençon and Dreux to the Eure River just short of Paris. This split the lodgment area (exclusive of Brittany) roughly into equal parts and postulated a twin drive by the 21 Army Group toward the lower Seine River (between Paris and the sea) and the 12th Army Group toward the upper Seine north of the Loire River (between Paris and Orléans). The pivot for the American turn was at a point just west of Alençon, almost sixty miles from the invasion coast.<sup>[1](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn23.html#fn1)</sup>"

Also, General Montgomery preferred to anchor the British forces on the small foothold secured by the end of June rather than attempt to enlarge the space that would determine the eventual wheeling maneuver. Montgomery had therefore instructed General Bradley to secure the American left on Caumont, less than twenty miles inland, and make a shallower turning movement, describing --440-- an arc through Fougères, about seventy miles north of the Loire River. This, the First Army had been unable to accomplish.",
        "Paragraph_5": "During the COBRA operation, the American left flank forces had been anchored on St. Lô. The success of COBRA and of the post-COBRA exploitation had enabled the forces on the right to sweep through the successive objectives of Laval and le Mans, about fifty miles north of the Loire. At the same time, the American pivot shifted south to the town of Vire. At the beginning of August, American and British troops were both driving to secure Vire as the point of the wheeling movement that had already started.<sup>[2](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn23.html#fn2)</sup>"

A lieutenant general by 1944, he assumed command of the First Army on 1 August and took control of three corps, the VII, the XIX, and the V."

The Germans were trying to stabilize their left flank, but despite counterattacks \"and the belated shifting of his reserves,\" the enemy appeared incapable of halting a First Army advance.<sup>[6](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn23.html#fn6)</sup> If eight divisions were shifted from the *Fifteenth Army,* the Germans could perhaps continue to fight along a general line from Rennes through Mortain, Falaise, and Trouville and thus prevent the emergence of Allied forces from Normandy. Otherwise, there could only be abandonment of the \"no retreat\" policy. Beyond that, it was possible even to foresee complete German collapse in the very near future. \"Only discipline,\" the First Army G-2 wrote,",

It is doubtful that the German forces in Normandy can continue for more than four to eight weeks as a military machine. One more heavy defeat such as the recent breakthrough battle which commenced 25 July will most probably result in the collapse of the forces now at the base of the Cherbourg Peninsula. Surrender or a disastrous retreat will be the alternative for the German forces. In the next four to eight weeks the current situation may change with dramatic suddenness into a race to reach a chaotic Germany.<sup>[7](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn23.html#fn7)</sup>",
