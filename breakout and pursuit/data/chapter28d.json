      "Event": "German Defensive Preparations and Withdrawal Planning",
      "Sub-event": "Hitler Directives and Model Orders on 20–21 August",
      "Sub-event_summary": "Hitler anticipates Allied attempt to destroy Army Group B between Argentan and lower Seine by thrusting downstream along west bank. He orders Model to establish defensive line at Touques River with Fifth Panzer and Seventh Armies or withdraw to Seine if unfeasible. Fifth Panzer Army to provide reception facilities on east bank and link with First Army defending Paris-Orléans gap. Model subordinates Seventh Army to Fifth Panzer Army under Dietrich on 20 August and issues detailed orders on 21 August for Touques defense, armored concentration near Evreux, and phased withdrawal if required.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_79": "Hitler was wrong on 20 August when he surmised that the Allies intended to capture Paris at once. Yet he guessed correctly that they would try to destroy the forces of Army Group B in the area between Argentan and the lower Seine, primarily by thrusting downstream along the west bank of the river. Hitler did not say how this was to be prevented, but he instructed Model to establish a defensive line at the Touques River with the admittedly \"badly battered\" Fifth Panzer and Seventh Armies. If Model found a defense at the Touques unfeasible, he was authorized to withdraw for a stand at the Seine. In this case, the Fifth Panzer Army was to provide reception facilities on the east bank of the Seine, protect crossings for the Seventh Army, and at the same time make contact with the First Army, which was to defend the Paris-Orléans gap and prevent an Allied advance toward Dijon.",
        "Paragraph_80": "Hitler obviously did not appreciate the extent of Fifth Panzer Army exhaustion, Seventh Army disorganization, and First Army weakness. Perhaps he was deluded by self-imposed blindness. Possibly he was the victim of the patently false reports and briefings that were later to become common practice. Perhaps he overestimated the effect of a not inconsiderable number of divisions that had been moving toward the battle zone in Normandy since the Mortain counterattack--the 6th Parachute, the 17th and 18th Luftwaffe Field, the 344th, 331st, 48th, and 338th Infantry--their purpose to cover Paris and the Army Group B rear. In any event, though Hitler hoped to stop the Allies at the Touques or at the Seine, he was already preparing to organize the Somme-Marne River line for defense.",
        "Paragraph_81": "Model on 20 August subordinated the Seventh Army to the Fifth Panzer Army (perhaps because Hausser had been wounded and was evacuated), thereby giving Dietrich command of the entire area from the coast to the First Army boundary (Chartres-Rambouillet-northwest outskirts of Paris). On 21 August he spelled out Dietrich's mission. The Fifth Panzer Army was to occupy and hold during the night of 21 August the Touques River-Lisieux-Orbec-Laigle line. Because it was \"of paramount importance\" to bolster the eastern flank in the Eure sector, Model ordered Dietrich to move all the armored units fit for combat (except those of the II SS Panzer Corps) to the vicinity of Evreux, the area Model considered most threatened. The eventual task of these forces was to regain contact with the Paris defenses of the First Army. Because a firm hold on the Seine River between Vernon and the army boundary was a prerequisite to successful defense in that area, a corps headquarters was to be charged with building defenses there; the arrival of the 49th Division at the Seine was to be accelerated by all available means. \"I am stressing in particular,\" Model stated, \"the importance of the sector between the Eure and the Seine River where an enemy breakthrough attempt to Louviers can be expected.\" The Fifth Panzer Army was to absorb all the Seventh Army headquarters. The armored units of the Seventh Army unfit for combat were to be sent to the Beauvais-Senlis area for rehabilitation under the LVIII Panzer Corps headquarters. Other units of the Seventh Army temporarily unfit for combat were to be dispatched across the Seine for rehabilitation, construction of fortifications along the Seine, and defense of the river line.",
        "Paragraph_82": "In another order issued the same day, Model informed Dietrich that if the development of the situation required withdrawal behind the Seine, the withdrawal was to be carried out in four steps, through a series of three intermediate positions.",
        "Paragraph_83": "On that date Dietrich organized his army front into three corps sectors, with the LXXXVI on the coast, the II SS Panzer in the center, and the LXXXI on the left. In compliance with Model's directive, he dispatched an armored group to the Evreux area--the remnants of the 2d, 1st SS, and 12th SS Panzer Divisions under I SS Panzer Corps."

The I SS Panzer Corps reported that the 10th SS Panzer Division had only a weak infantry battalion (perhaps 300 men), no tanks, no guns; the 12th SS Panzer Division had 300 men, 10 tanks, no artillery; the 1st SS Panzer Division was unable to give any figures. The II SS Panzer Corps reported that the 2d SS Panzer Division had 450 men, 15 tanks, 6 guns; the 9th SS Panzer Division had 460 men, 20 to 25 tanks, and 20 guns; the 116th Panzer Division had one battalion of infantry (perhaps 500 or 600 men), 12 tanks, and no artillery.",

Hodges was to use the XIX Corps, which had been pinched out of the western portion (upper jaw) of the Argentan-Falaise pocket. In the same kind of displacement from the upper to the lower jaw that the V Corps headquarters had made from Tinchebray to Argentan, the XIX Corps and its divisions were to displace more than a hundred miles in a large and complicated troop movement from the vicinity of Flers to cover the gap between the V and XV Corps--from Gacé to Dreux. The corps moved and by 19 August was concentrated (with the 2d Armored, 28th, and 30th Divisions) in the Mortagne-Brezolles area. From there the XIX Corps was to attack north toward the Seine. The XIX and XV Corps would thus fashion a two-corps drive straddling the Eure River, with the divisions of the XIX on the left attacking to Elbeuf and XV (5th Armored Division) on the right attacking to Louviers."

Encounters strong opposition from Kampfgruppe Mohnke (improvised panzer elements under Wahl, Fick, Mohnke) using favorable terrain, ravines, woods, fog, rain, Panzerfausts, and antitank grenades. Division requires five days of hard fighting to advance approximately twenty miles.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_88": "The LXXXI Corps, which since 16 August had had the difficult mission of screening the south flank of both German armies in Normandy from Gacé to Paris, was scheduled to defend the Eure River line. When parts of the 344th Division (a static division released by the Fifteenth Army) arrived near Gacé on 17 August, conglomerate forces under the headquarters of Panzer Lehr were pulled out of the line and sent east of the Seine for rehabilitation. Soon afterwards, portions of the 6th Parachute and 331st Divisions came into the sector and were committed on the 344th left (east). The 17th Luftwaffe Field Division, previously employed at Le Havre as a static division, took positions near Dreux so hastily that its commitment could not be executed in an orderly or unified manner. These units were far from impressive; besides being understrength, they were poorly trained. Yet an SS captain named Wahl, the trains commander of the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division, had on his own initiative been gathering tanks from all sources (for the most part from the 2d SS, 9th SS, and 2d Panzer Divisions), principally replacement tanks on their way to units; Wahl assembled these to protect the Seine crossing sites. On 19 August combat remnants of the 17th SS Panzer Grenadiers under Fick joined Wahl. Two days later contingents of the 1st SS Panzer Division provided further reinforcement between the Eure and the Seine, and the whole improvised formation became known as Kampfgruppe Mohnke.",
        "Paragraph_89": "While the 79th Division started across the Seine on the evening of 19 August, a 5th Armored Division liaison officer was carrying from the corps headquarters to the division command post the order to drive downstream. Rain and a black night prevented him from reaching the division until shortly before dawn, 20 August. A few hours later armored units were moving. Referring not only to the celerity of execution of the corps order but also to the Seine crossing, General Haislip declared, \"What we did last night was a Lulu.\" There was no doubt about it.",
        "Paragraph_90": "The object of the armored drive down the Seine was to force the Germans as close to the mouth of the river as possible. Between Mantes-Gassicourt and Rouen, the Seine, averaging some five hundred feet in width, was suitable in many places for bridging and had many ferry slips. North of Rouen, the width of one thousand to twelve hundred feet and the tidal range would present the Germans with more hazardous and difficult crossings.",
        "Paragraph_91": "The first objective of the attack between the Eure and the Seine was to cut the German escape routes leading to the Seine River crossings between Vernon and Pont de l'Arche. Though Montgomery's order issued on 20 August directed an advance \"to Louviers, and Elbeuf, and beyond,\" Patton on the previous evening had instructed Haislip to drive on Louviers and Elbeuf, the latter forty miles from Mantes, until relieved by elements of the XIX Corps; the 5th Armored Division was then to return to Mantes-Gassicourt. A day later Patton limited Haislip and told him to deny the Germans the use of crossing sites as far north as Louviers until relieved by XIX Corps on his left. Haislip designated Louviers, thirty miles from Mantes, as the final objective, and Maj. Gen. Lunsford E. Oliver, the division commander, indicated intermediate objectives at Vernon and at the loop of the Seine near les Andelys, ten and twenty miles from Mantes, respectively.",
        "Paragraph_92": "Almost immediately after leaving their positions about eight miles northwest of Mantes on 20 August, the 5th Armored Division ran into strong opposition from the kampfgruppe of panzer elements commanded successively by Wahl, Fick, and Col. Wilhelm Mohnke. The Germans fought skillfully, using to good advantage terrain features favorable for defense, numerous ravines and woods in particular. Fog and rain that continued for several days provided additional cover for German ambush parties using Panzerfausts and antitank grenades against American tanks. It took the armored division five days of hard fighting to advance about twenty miles and accomplish its mission."

The relentless pressure exerted by the XIX and XV Corps during four days rolled up the panzer army left flank for almost half the length of the army front. Model's plan, outlined on 21 August, for an orderly retrograde movement in four successive phases, came to naught, and the units on the northern flank of the army, those facing the British, had to accelerate their withdrawal.",

They therefore deployed the battered splinters of eight panzer divisions along the southern part of the front, between the Risle and Seine Rivers."

But pressed against the west bank, the German units were fast being compressed into the wooded peninsular pieces of land formed by the loops of the river north of Elbeuf and Bourgtheroulde. As Allied artillery fire fell into this area, destroying vehicles and personnel jammed at entrances to river crossings, the Germans fought to maintain defensive lines and keep their escape facilities operating."

The First Canadian Army had been attacking eastward since 16 August, when units crossed the Dives River in the coastal sector near Mézidon. British airborne troops under Canadian control broadened the offensive by attacking in the marshes near Cabourg. Progress against the German forces that had not been involved in the Argentan-Falaise action was slow, for the withdrawal by the German units outside the pocket was well planned and orderly, with demolitions, obstacles, and mines left in wake of the rear guards. The Canadian army did not reach and cross the Touques River until 22 August, when the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade, moving along the coast, arrived at Deauville. On that day Montgomery released the 2d Canadian Corps for an advance to the Seine. Two days later units breached the Touques defenses at Lisieux. Bypassing the city, the Canadians drove on toward Bernay to maintain contact as the German withdrawal to the Seine began to accelerate. On 26 August Canadian forces were at Bourgtheroulde, where they relieved the XIX U.S. Corps of responsibility for Elbeuf. On the following day other Canadian forces in the coastal sector, among them the Royal Netherlands (Princess Irene's) Brigade, approached the mouth of the Seine.",

In accordance with arrangements made on 24 August, Americans of the XIX and XV Corps withdrew along the west bank of the Seine south across the army group boundary. British and American columns alternately used crossroads and completed the transfer of territory with relative ease. The administrative headache earlier envisioned never developed."

Model orders withdrawal behind Seine in one bound night of 25–26 August; armored remnants form reserves near Rouen and Beauvais. Seventh Army remnants move to Somme-St. Quentin for rehabilitation. Troops trapped west of Seine face inadequate ferries, congestion, and disorder; ~25,000 vehicles cross by 24 August, but personnel crossings chaotic with priority disputes and force used.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_106": "With I SS Panzer Corps in command of the 49th Infantry and 18th Luftwaffe Field Divisions on the east bank of the Seine generally south of Louviers, Dietrich on 24 August proposed a reorganization of command for those forces still west of the river--the LXXXVI and LXXXI Corps were to assume control of all the infantry divisions, the II SS Panzer Corps of all the armored divisions. On the following day he put it into effect. He drew his corps boundaries so that the LXXX VI controlled the units on the Fifth Panzer Army right, the LXXXI those in the center, and the I SS Panzer (on the east bank) those on the left. The armored units under the II SS Panzer Corps and concentrated on the southern flank of the German bridgehead west of the Seine had no designated sector of their own. Though thousands of troops--estimated by the Second British Army between forty and fifty thousand--were still west of the Seine, the Germans were hoping to organize a coherent front on the east bank. There the Fifth Panzer Army would operate in a sector between the Fifteenth Army (in the coastal area south to Le Havre) and the First Army (covering Paris and the rest of the Army Group B front).",
        "Paragraph_107": "Model on 25 August instructed Dietrich to withdraw the few units still west of the Risle River across the river that night, and all the forces in the Seine River bridgehead behind the Seine in one bound on the following night. Once across the Seine, the army was to organize and reinforce positions in such a manner as to assure successful defense of the river line. In addition, the remnants of the armored units were to be formed into two reserve groups--one to be located northeast of Rouen, the other near Beauvais. The II Parachute Corps headquarters was to move to Nancy for rehabilitation under control of the First Parachute Army. The Seventh Army was to move the remnants of eleven divisions unfit for combat--the 3d Parachute, the 84th, 85th, 89th, 243d, 272d, 276th, 277th, 326th, 363d, and 708th Infantry, plus other splinter units--to the Somme River-St. Quentin area in the rear for rehabilitation. In addition, all elements of these units that could be spared were to construct fortifications along the Somme.",
        "Paragraph_108": "Thus, though the Germans were preparing to defend along the Seine, the plans seemed impossible of execution. According to one estimate--probably too low--of the battle strength of the Fifth Panzer Army on 25 August, 18,000 infantrymen, 314 artillery pieces, and 42 tanks and self-propelled guns were arrayed against the Allies who, in addition to their overwhelming superiority in the air, in ammunition, and in gasoline supplies, were estimated to have more than 100,000 infantry in line and 90,000 in immediate reserve, 1,300 artillery pieces deployed and 1,100 in reserve, 1,900 tanks in operation on the front and 2,000 more in reserve.",
        "Paragraph_109": "Holding at the Seine appeared a slim prospect. The Somme River line seemed to offer the only possible position for the next stand.",
        "Paragraph_110": "Before any stand could be made, the troops jammed against the west bank of the Seine had to be extricated and brought across the river. They were virtually trapped. Three days had been necessary in July and early August to move two divisions abreast westward across the Seine toward the front; it was therefore obvious that a crossing in reverse under the unfavorable conditions of late August would allow little more than personnel to get to the east bank. The approaches to the ferries were inadequate, and the remnants of the Seventh Army congested the approaches. By 25 August eighteen major ferries and several smaller ones were still operating in the Rouen area; miscellaneous boats and rafts made hazardous trips; one small bridge to Rouen was still intact. These facilities were hardly adequate for the thousands of troops who in some instances fought among themselves for transportation across the river. Orderly movement was difficult if not impossible. Though it was generally agreed that tanks were to be saved first, SS formations often insisted that they had priority over all other units, and it was sometimes necessary for high-ranking commanders to resort to the use of force or at least the threat of force in order to carry out the semblance of an orderly procedure. Some \"unpleasant scenes\" took place at the Seine.",
        "Paragraph_111": "Despite some disorder and panic, the Germans managed to get a surprisingly large number of troops to the east bank of the Seine, mostly on 26 and 27 August. To the Germans, it seemed that the British and Canadians did not push as hard as they might have. Neither did the Allied air forces seem as active as usual during the critical days of the withdrawal. The Seine ferries that remained in service operated even during daylight hours.",
        "Paragraph_112": "This achievement was rather hollow. There was no longer any option of defending at the Seine or even hoping for an orderly withdrawal east of the river. The escaping units were weak and close to exhaustion."
