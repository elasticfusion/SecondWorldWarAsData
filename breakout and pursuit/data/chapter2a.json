        "Paragraph_1": "Adolf Hitler was directing the war. In addition to the responsibility and the nominal command borne by all heads of states, Hitler exercised a direct control over military operations. He determined the military strategy on all fronts and supervised closely the formulation of plans and their execution. Increasingly, as the struggle continued, he controlled the tactical operations of the troops. This close control of the military was perhaps inevitable. The pyramidal hierarchy of command reached its ultimate in him.",
        "Paragraph_2": "With an active and bold imagination, and often displaying an astute grasp of military matters, Hitler could coordinate his military objectives and his political goals far better than anyone else in Germany. Though by 1944 Hitler had delegated to others many of his governmental functions, he felt that he could not afford to do so in the military realm. The urgency of the life and death struggle with the Allies, he was convinced, compelled him to give his personal attention even to relatively minor problems, and his self-assumed commitments overworked him."

His staff was the Armed Forces High Command, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), headed by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel. Theoretically, OKW was the highest military echelon under Hitler, and to it belonged the prerogatives of grand strategy and joint operations. On a lower echelon, Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering headed the Air Force High Command, the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL); Grossadmiral Karl Doenitz headed the Navy High Command, the Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine (OKM); while Hitler himself headed the Army High Command, the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH).",
        "Paragraph_4": "In theory, the chief of the OKW, Keitel, received the reports and co-ordinated the activities of the OKL, OKM, and OKH. But Goering outranked Keitel and therefore reported directly to Hitler. Doenitz felt that Keitel had little interest in and understanding of naval matters, and he also reported directly to Hitler. Since Hitler himself was chief of the OKH, there seemed to be no practical need for the OKW. Yet because the war against the Soviet Union required all the attention of the OKH, the OKW assumed the direction of the other theaters.² OKW and OKH were thus reduced to agencies directing the ground campaigns and, together with OKL and OKM, were directly subordinate to and dominated by Hitler, the Supreme Commander in Chief."

        "Paragraph_5": "Although the chain of command was unified at the top in the person of Hitler and although spheres of activity seemed clearly defined among the high commands, staff functions in actual practice were often confused. OKW, for example, had no intelligence section or logistical apparatus. For information about the enemy and for administration, including replacements, it relied on the OKH. OKL organized and controlled antiaircraft artillery units, Luftwaffe field divisions, and paratroopers, which in American doctrine were ground force units. Competition over such matters as replacements caused friction among the services. Goering exploited his political power, while Reichsfuehrer Heinrich Himmler complicated the command structure because he headed the Schutzstaffel (SS), an elite corps of infantry and armored units.³ Similar inconsistencies appeared in the field. Commanders exercised control over assigned troops but not over strictly defined geographical areas. Except in designated fortress cities, the three military services were independent branches, expected to co-operate but not functionally organized to insure complete co-ordination of effort. The result, perhaps not so surprisingly, redounded to Hitler's personal advantage."

        "Paragraph_11": "South of the boundary was the sector of Army Group G, a headquarters that controlled the First Army, which defended the Atlantic coast of France south of the Loire, and Nineteenth Army, which held the Mediterranean shores of France. The Replacement Army, which trained units in the interior of France, furnished troops for security duties against the FFI and was ready to undertake operations against airborne landings.",
        "Paragraph_12": "North of the Loire-Geneva boundary line was Army Group B. Under this headquarters, LXXXVIII Corps occupied the Netherlands, Fifteenth Army defended the coast of Belgium and of northern France to the Seine River, and Seventh Army had responsibility for that part of northwest France between the Seine and the Loire Rivers."
