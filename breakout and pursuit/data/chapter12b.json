He found the sky overcast, the clouds thick. Deciding that visibility was inadequate for the air attack, he ordered a postponement. Unfortunately, he was too late. The message announcing his decision reached England only a few minutes before the actual bombing was to commence in France. Although the planes were ordered to return without making their bomb runs, it was impossible to get them all back. In accordance with the original planning, six groups of fighter-bombers of the IX TAC and three bombardment divisions (about 1,600 heavy bombers) of the Eighth U.S. Air Force had departed their bases in England and headed toward France. Only the medium bombers, scheduled to bomb last, had not left the ground when the postponement order came. Of the six groups of fighter-bombers in the air, three received the recall order before they dropped their bombs. The other three bombed the general target area, the narrow strip, and certain targets north of the Périers-St. Lô highway, with no observed results. The postponement message to the heavy bombers stayed only a few planes in the last formation. Ignorant that C OBRA had been postponed, pilots of the great majority of the heavy bombers guided their big craft on toward the target. Because no precise radio channels had been designated for emergency communication, there was no certain means of transmitting the news to the planes. While air force personnel in France attempted to get word to the craft aloft, the first formation of 500 planes arrived over the target area. Fortunately, they found visibility so poor that no attack was made. The second formation found cloud conditions so bad that only 35 aircraft, after making three bomb runs to identify the target, released their loads. Over 300 bombers of the third formation, with slightly improved weather conditions, dropped their bombs--about 550 tons of high explosive and 135 tons of fragmentation--before the postponement message finally got through to cancel the remainder of the strike."

The poor weather conditions had prompted commanders to wonder whether the lack of visibility would cancel the air bombardment, but General Collins was characteristically optimistic. He believed that the planes would get through the haze. Even if the heavy bombers were not able to take part in the air attack, he felt that the fighter-bombers would be on hand and that their bombardment would give sufficient impetus for the attack. He therefore told his subordinate commanders to go ahead. If the fighter-bomber effort proved insufficient, he expected the heavy bombers to return on the following day."

What then was the meaning of the bombs that were dropped? What was the mission of the ground troops? Was C OBRA delayed? Or were the ground troops to initiate C OBRA on the basis of the incomplete air effort? While discussion took place at higher headquarters, General Collins decided that the VII Corps had to attack. Withdrawal of the 9th and 30th Divisions had created a vacuum that the Germans would fill unless the infantry returned to the vicinity of the Périers-St. Lô highway. If C OBRA was to start without benefit of the full air preparation, the infantry could simply continue the attack, cross the line of departure at the highway, and attempt to pry open the Marigny--St. Gilles gap. If, on the other hand, postponement in the air meant postponement on the ground, then the same conditions on which the C OBRA plan was based had to be restored. General Collins therefore told the 9th, 4th, and 30th Divisions, the units scheduled to initiate the C OBRA offensive, to make a limited objective attack to the Périers-St. Lô highway. Maybe they would continue beyond the highway, maybe not.",
        "Paragraph_13": "Half an hour later General Collins learned that C OBRA was postponed on the ground as well as in the air, but to prevent the enemy from moving north of the Périers-St. Lô highway, the three infantry divisions were to attack at 1300 as though C OBRA were going into effect. In reality, the divisions were to restore the front line that had existed before the air bombardment."

Even General Quesada, the commander of the IX TAC, dispatched a telegram of indignant protest on the direction of the heavy-bomber approach (his fighter-bombers had made a lateral approach). Quesada demanded whether \"another plan\" had actually been employed."

Perhaps something was inexcusably wrong, since C OBRA had been conceived and planned, not hastily, but thoroughly over a period of almost two weeks. At the conference between General Bradley and air representatives on 19 July, when the C OBRA air arrangements were being worked out, the direction of the bombing approach had \"evoked considerable discussion.\" General Bradley had insisted on his parallel plan, while all the Air Forces representatives had argued that perpendicular runs were more suitable. At the end of the conference the question had not been settled formally, though General Bradley must have assumed that his recommendation for lateral bomb runs would be accepted. The Air Forces representatives had understood that General Bradley \"was aware of the possibility of gross [bombing] errors causing casualties\" among his troops, and they thought he had said \"that he was prepared to accept such casualties no matter which way the planes approached.\" Unaware of this conception, General Bradley had considered the conference \"very satisfactory.\" Even though Air Chief Marshal Leigh-Mallory had had to \"rush off\" before its conclusion, General Quesada had remained throughout. The result of what in reality had been an unsatisfactory conference was an absence of firm understanding and mutual agreement.",
        "Paragraph_20": "The approach route was not the only difficulty. General Bradley recalled after the war that he had gained the impression that the air forces would use bombs no heavier than 100 pounds and was surprised when larger bombs were dropped. Yet during Bradley's conference at the First Army command post on 12 July, General Collins had asked, \"Do we get heavy or medium bombs or both?\" and Bradley had replied, \"Both.\" The 260-pound bomb in Bradley's estimation did not \"make too big a crater.\" Collins, who wanted to take a chance on the cratering, had voted for \"bigger and better bombs,\" even 500-pound bombs, while General Quesada had suggested that 260-pound bombs would be large enough. The discussion had not cleared up the matter, and when the conference ended the question was still not settled."

Or should he insist on changing the pattern of air attack, which would mean postponing C OBRA for several days at least? With higher headquarters anxious for action, General Bradley had little choice. The ground attack on the afternoon of 24 July had re-established the necessary C OBRA conditions. Prospects for good weather on 25 July were improving. The question whether the premature bombing had lost the Americans tactical surprise was to be resolved at once: the Allies would launch C OBRA again at 1100, 25 July."

        "Paragraph_25": "The earth shook. Bombing heights had been fixed around 15,000 feet, but the presence of clouds forced readjustment in flight. Most bombardiers had to recompute their figures en route. Some planes bombed from the relatively low altitude of 12,000 feet, which brought them closer to the enemy antiaircraft fire and thus added to pilot strain, loosened flight formations, and increased the hazards of crowded air over the target. Artillery smoke markers proved of little value because they were not visible until the smoke drifted to high altitudes, and by that time the wind had dispersed and displaced it. Once the attack began, great clouds of dust and smoke obscured not only markers but terrain features as well. Furthermore, the red smoke of artillery markers could hardly be distinguished from shell and bomb bursts and from muzzle flashes of American and German artillery. Because it was impossible to keep bomb formations tight and because the crew members had been impressed with the necessity of avoiding short bombing, a good portion of the bombs landed south of the target area or west and east of it. Some bombs, however, again fell north of the Périers-St. Lô highway and on American positions."
