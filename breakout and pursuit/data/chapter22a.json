      "Sub-event_summary": "Hitler evaluates the serious German situation following the American breakthrough at Avranches, considering external defections in the Balkans, Finland, and potential Turkish entry against Germany, internal threats from the July 20th Putsch, Soviet advances on the Eastern Front, and the critical Western Front breakthrough threatening withdrawal from France.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_2": "The seriousness of the German situation at the time of the American breakthrough to Avranches was not lost on Hitler.<sup>[1](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn1)</sup> The Balkans and Finland were about to be lost, and there were indications that Turkey might soon enter the war against Germany. Hitler considered these events as a kind of external defection over which he had little control. The *Putsch* of July 20th, on the other hand, was an internal defection that threatened him personally, and he was increasingly uneasy over the feeling that disloyalty had permeated the entire German military organization even to the highest levels.",
        "Paragraph_3": "Soviet advances sent his Eastern Front reeling, but because construction had been started in July on a new defense line stretching from East Prussia to the Carpathians, Hitler hoped that his forces would somehow hold. His main concern lay in the west, for he had long considered the west the vital sector of what had become, at least for the moment, a defensive war.",
        "Paragraph_4": "The breakthrough on the Western Front posed the ominous possibility that the Germans might have to withdraw from France. With France lost, the threat of Allied penetration of the German homeland would become immediate. The Seine River, with its deep bends and twists, was difficult to defend and could be no more than a temporary rallying position, but between the Seine and the Rhine were a number of historic water obstacles where the Germans could hope to stop the Allies short of the German border. To utilize the water barriers, Jodl sketched a major defensive belt across Belgium and France (and into northern Italy) that consisted of two lines: the Somme-Marne-Saone River line, and the Albert Canal-Meuse River line, both anchored on the Vosges Mountains."

Although neglected for four years and partially dismantled, the West Wall in the summer of 1944 was not a negligible defensive factor. Late in July Jodl ordered the West Wall repaired and rearmed and the river lines in France prepared for defense. The Todt Organization was to cease work on the Atlantic Wall and commence construction of defensive positions along the newly projected lines inland. Authority was granted to impress civilians for work on roads and defenses in Belgium and France.",
        "Paragraph_6": "In addition to the erection of defensive positions, Hitler enunciated on the last day of July a two-point policy directed against Allied logistics. He ordered his forces to deny the Allies ports of entry on the Continent and, if a withdrawal from France became necessary, to destroy the transportation system there by demolishing railroads, bridges, and communications.",
        "Paragraph_7": "Though withdrawal from France was extremely undesirable, Hitler foresaw the possible necessity of it. He indicated as much by ordering the movement of some units out of the Balkans and Italy for defense of the homeland, thereby accepting the probability of losing the Balkans immediately and the calculated risk of having to withdraw in Italy to the Alps. Hitler also quickened preparations for raising a reserve force within Germany."

Since the war in western Europe had reached a critical stage, he took responsibility for the battle upon himself. Creating a small staff taken from members of the OKW planning section *(WFSt)* to help him, Hitler sought to recreate the conditions of static warfare while at the same time preparing to withdraw in the event of failure. By this move, Hitler in effect assumed the functions of theater commander and filled the virtual vacuum in the chain of command that had existed since Rommel's incapacitation and Kluge's assumption of dual command of *Army Group B* and *OB WEST.* Ordering Kluge to close the gap in the left portion of the German defenses and to anchor the front on Avranches, Hitler forbade the commanders in the field to look backward toward defensive lines in the rear."

The first was the more cautious: to break off the battle in Normandy and withdraw behind delaying action to the Seine while *Army Group G* evacuated southern France. This would have the virtue of saving the main body of German troops, though admittedly at the expense of heavy losses, especially in matériel. Eberbach later claimed that, when Warlimont visited the front about 1 August, he, Eberbach, suggested an immediate withdrawal to the Seine, a recommendation Warlimont rejected as being \"politically unbearable and tactically impractical.\"<sup>[3](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn3)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_12": "*OB WEST* could understand OKW's reluctance to withdraw, for pulling back to the Seine would more than likely be the first step toward retirement behind the West Wall. If the Germans did not succeed in holding the relatively short front in Normandy, then only at the West Wall--another relatively short defensive line that could be reinforced-- was there a prospect of success. The consequences of such a decision would be hard to accept--surrender of France with all the political and economic implications of it, loss of long-range projectile bases along the Pas-de-Calais, unfavorable reaction in Italy that might lead to the loss of a region valuable to the German war economy, withdrawals on other fronts to project the homeland.",

To do so, the breach at Avranches would have to be closed, a step that appeared tactically feasible at the beginning of August. If the gap were not closed, there would be an unavoidable crisis on the front, for the likelihood of being able to pull back across the Seine at that late date would be slim.",
        "Paragraph_14": "As events developed, Hitler left *OB WEST* no choice. He ordered the forces in the west to continue fighting in Normandy even as Kluge was already trying to remedy the situation at Avranches."

The *84th* and *85th Divisions* were moving from the Pas-de-Calais toward Falaise. The *89th Division* had just crossed the Seine River, and the *331st Division* was in the process of being ferried across. Parts of the *363d Division* were already in the *Seventh Army* rear and were being committed in the *LXXXIV Corps* sector. From southern France came the *708th Division,* which was crossing the Loire River near Angers, and the *9th Panzer Division,* which was moving toward the Loire for eventual assembly near Alencon. Whether all would get to the front in time to be of use before the situation in the Avranches sector deteriorated completely was the vital question. It appeared that at least three divisions, the *363d,* the *84th,* and the *89th,* would be\n\n*--421--*\n\n<a id=\"page422\"></a>\n\n* * *\n\navailable at Avranches during the first week in August.<sup>[4](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn4)</sup> *([Map IX](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-IX.jpg) )*"

      "Sub-event_summary": "Description of the front line, with Panzer Group West (renamed Fifth Panzer Army) mostly quiet except one sector, Seventh Army hard pressed, organization of corps and divisions, placement of XXV Corps under Army Group B, extension of First Army control, and LXXXI Corps to control new divisions on left flank.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_16": "Except at Avranches, the situation along the front was far from desperate. Eberbach's *Panzer Group West,* which was to change its name on 5 August to the *Fifth Panzer Army,* was actively engaged only in one sector. The *LXXXVI Corps,* the I SS *Panzer Corps,* and the *LXXIV Corps* controlled quiet zones, as did the *LVIII Panzer Corps* headquarters, recently brought up from southern France. Only the II SS *Panzer Corps* was fighting hard by 2 August, having committed all three of its divisions against the British attack launched on 30 July south of Caumont toward the town of Vire.",
        "Paragraph_17": "Hausser's *Seventh Army* front, on the other hand, was hard pressed. In a narrow sector just east of the Vire River, the *II Parachute Corps* had only the *3d Parachute Division* to defend the town of Vire. West of the Vire River to the Foret de St. Sever, the *XLVII Panzer Corps* controlled the *2d Panzer Division* (which had absorbed the *352d Division)* and the *2d SS Panzer Division* (which had absorbed the remnants of *Panzer Lehr* and the *17th SS Panzer Grenadiers).* On the left, *LXXXIV Corps* directed the *353d Division* and the *116th Panzer Division* on a front from the St. Sever forest to the See River. Provisional units, formed from remnants and stragglers (including the *5th Parachute Division)* and operating under the staff of the *275th Division,* covered the gap south of the Sée River and east of Avranches, and the weak *91st Infantry Division* was at Rennes.<sup>[5](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn5)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_18": "Since the *Seventh Army* (or any other outside ground headquarters) could not exercise effective command of the *XXV Corps* in Brittany, Kluge placed the corps directly under *Army Group B* as a matter of administration. Writing off the *XXV Corps* in this manner in accordance with Hitler's orders emphasized the floating nature of the Normandy left flank. The weak forces at Rennes were obviously unable to offer sustained resistance. A large opening between the Sée and Loire Rivers invited American exploitation eastward toward the Paris-Orleans gap.<sup>[6](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn6)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_19": "To cover the gap thus exposed, Kluge on 2 August ordered the *First Army* to extend its control northward from the Biscay coast of France to the Loire River, take command of the forces along the Loire, and hold bridgeheads on the north bank at the crossing sites between Nantes and Orleans. On the same day Kluge also ordered the *LXXXI Corps* headquarters to hurry south from the coastal sector between the Seine and the Somme Rivers to take control of the arriving *708th Infantry* and *9th Panzer Divisions* on a refused *Seventh Army* left flank in the Domfront-Alençon sector.<sup>[7](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn7)</sup> With these measures taken, Kluge turned his attention\n\n*--422--*\n\n<a id=\"page423\"></a>\n\n* * *\n\nto regaining Avranches as the new anchor point of the defensive line in Normandy."

        "Paragraph_20": "If Avranches were to be regained, a counterattack had to be launched immediately. Where to get the troops for it was the problem, and Hitler provided the solution. On 2 August, in ordering a strong armored counterattack, Hitler authorized a slight withdrawal to a shorter line (Thury-Harcourt through the town of Vire to the western edge of the Forêt de St. Sever). A shortened front and the arrival of new units would give Kluge the means with which to counterattack to Avranches.<sup>[8](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn8)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_21": "Specifically, Hitler first thought of disengaging the *II SS Panzer Corps* (the *9th SS,* the *10th SS,* and the *21st Panzer Divisions)* for the counterattack, but Kluge felt this impossible because of the British pressure south of Caumont. Kluge recommended that the *XLVII Panzer Corps,* which was nearer the critical sector, make the effort with the *2d* and *2d SS Panzer Divisions* reinforced at first by the *LXXXIV Corps' 116th Panzer Division* and later by the incoming *9th Panzer Division* (after the latter moved from Alençon to Sourdeval near Mortain). Since there was some question whether the *9th* would arrive in Alençon in time to participate, Kluge suggested that additional armor be secured by pulling the *1st SS* or the *12th SS Panzer Division* out of the Caen sector where the British appeared to have become quiet, a risk that Eberbach had agreed to accept. Jodl approved Kluge's proposals.<sup>[9](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn9)</sup>",

The divisions were to be relieved from the line by 6 August through withdrawal to a shorter front.<sup>[10](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn10)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_23": "While the *LXXIV* and II SS *Panzer Corps* in the *Panzer Group West* sector prepared to withdraw during the night of 3 August in order to disengage the *1st SS Panzer Division,* Hausser planned to disengage the other three divisions from his *Seventh Army* front by executing a three-phase withdrawal. The *2d, 2d SS,* and *116th Panzer Divisions* were to be pulled out of the line in that order on three successive nights starting 3 August and assembled in the area east of Mortain by 6 August. To make this possible, the *II Parachute Corps* was to extend its responsibility to the west to take control of a regiment of the *353d Division,* and the *LXXXIV Corps* was to integrate the arriving *363d* and *84th Divisions* into its front. The *XLVII Panzer Corps,* which was to direct the attack, received the *275th* as left flank cover. With three armored divisions moving abreast in an initial assault and a fourth ready to exploit initial success, the *XLVII Panzer Corps* commander, Funck, was to attack after dark on 6 August without artillery preparation.\n\n*--423--*\n\n<a id=\"page424\"></a>\n\n* * *\n\n[![General Haislip](:/dc3701571f7f4237bea1d8c7b6937846)](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/img/USA-E-Breakout-p424.jpg)  \nGeneral Haislip\n\nHis objective was to reach the Cotentin west coast and secure Avranches.<sup>[11](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn11)</sup>"
