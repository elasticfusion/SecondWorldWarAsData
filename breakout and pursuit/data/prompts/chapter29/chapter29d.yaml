> men in the Paris area belonged to the FFI, but few actually had weapons since the Allies had parachuted only small quantities of military goods to them. While the Resistance had been able to carry on a somewhat systematic program of sabotage and harassment--destroying road signs, planting devices designed to puncture automobile tires, cutting communications lines, burning gasoline depots, and attacking isolated Germans--for the FFI to engage German armed forces in open warfare was quite another matter.<sup>[21](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn21)</sup>
>
> The leaders of the Resistance in Paris, recognizing the havoc that German guns could bring to an overtly insubordinate civilian population and fearing widespread and bloody reprisals, sought to avert open hostilities. They were fortunate in securing the good offices of Mr. Raoul Nordling, the Swedish consul general, who volunteered to negotiate with Choltitz. Nordling had that very day succeeded in persuading Choltitz not to deport but to release from detention camps, hospitals, and prisons several thousand political prisoners. The agreement, which "represented the first capitulation of Germany," was a matter of considerable import that "was not lost either on the Resistance or on the people of Paris."<sup>[22](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn22)</sup> Having established a personal relationship with Choltitz that promised to be valuable, Nordling was able to learn on the evening of 19 August that Choltitz was willing to discuss conditions of a truce with the Resistance. That night an armistice was arranged, at first to last only a few hours, later extended by mutual consent for an indefinite period.
>
> Without even a date of expiration, the arrangement was nebulous. Choltitz agreed to treat Resistance members as soldiers and to regard certain parts of the city as Resistance territory. In return, he secured Resistance admission that certain sections of Paris were to be free for German use, for the unhampered passage of German troops. Yet no boundaries were drawn, and neither Germans nor French were certain of their respective sectors. Thus, an uneasy noninterference obtained.<sup>[23](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn23)</sup>
>
> The advantages for both parties were clear. The French Resistance leaders were uncertain when Allied troops would arrive, anxious to prevent German repressive measures, aware of Resistance weakness to the extent of doubting their own ability to defend the public buildings seized, and finally hopeful of preserving the capital from physical damage.
>
> For the Germans, the cessation of hostilities per se fulfilled Choltitz' mission of maintaining order within the capital and enabled him to attend to his primary mission of blocking the approaches to the city. Having known for a long time of the attempts to subordinate the Resistance to the Allied military command, the Germans guessed that sabotage directly unrelated to Allied military operations was "mainly the work

> of communist groups."<sup>[24](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn24)</sup> It was therefore reasonable for Choltitz to assume that the disorder in Paris on 19 August, which had no apparent connection with developments on the front, was the work of a few extremists. Since part of his mission was to keep order among the population and since the police were no longer performing their duties, Choltitz felt that the simplest way of restoring order was to halt the gunfire in the streets. To prevent what might develop into indiscriminate rioting, he was willing to come to an informal truce, "an understanding," as he termed it.<sup>[25](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn25)</sup>
>
> A more subtle reason also lay behind Choltitz' action. Aware of the factionalism in the French Resistance movement, he tried to play one group off against the other to simplify his problem of control.<sup>[26](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn26)</sup> Choltitz believed that since the insurrectionists directed their immediate efforts toward seizing government buildings and communications facilities, the insurrection was at least in part the opening of an undisguised struggle for political power within France. The Pétain government no longer functioned in Paris (Pétainist officials with whom the Germans were accustomed to work no longer answered their telephones), and in this vacuum there was bound to be a struggle for power among the Resistance factions. "The Resistance had reason to fear," a German official wrote not long afterwards, "that the Communists would take possession of the city before the Americans arrived."<sup>[27](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn27)</sup> By concluding a truce, Choltitz hoped to destroy the cement that held the various French groups together against their common enemy and thus leave them free to destroy themselves.
>
> That Choltitz felt it necessary to use these means rather than force to suppress the insurrection indicated one of two things--either he was unwilling to endanger the lives of women and children or he no longer had the strength to cope with the Resistance. He later admitted to both. In any event, French underground activities had become so annoying that Choltitz' staff had planned a coordinated attack on widely dispersed Resistance headquarters for the very day the insurrection broke out, but Choltitz himself had suddenly prohibited the action. Instead of resorting to force, he listened to representations in favor of peace from the neutral Swedish and Swiss consulates. Meanwhile, should civil disturbance become worse, Choltitz gathered provisional units to augment his strength, securing, among other units, a tank company of *Panzer Lehr*.<sup>[28](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn28)</sup>
>
> Choltitz apparently informed Model, the new chief of *OB WEST* and *Army Group B,* of his weakness, for when Hitler on 20 August advised Model that Paris was to become the bastion of the Seine-Yonne River line, Model replied that the plan was not feasible. Although Model had arranged to move the *348th Division* to Paris, he did not think these troops could arrive quickly enough

> to hold the city against the external Allied threat and the internal Resistance disturbance. Apparently having misunderstood Hitler's desire, Model decided that the Seine was more important than Paris. Since the Seine flows through the city, defending at the river would necessitate a main line of resistance inside the capital. With the civil populace in a state of hardly disguised revolt, he did not believe Choltitz could keep civil order and at the same time defend against an Allied attack with the strength at hand. Model therefore revealed to OKW that he had ordered an alternate line of defense to be reconnoitred north and east of Paris.<sup>[29](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn29)</sup>
>
> Model's action seemed inexcusable since the order to create a fortress city implied that Paris was important enough in Hitler's judgment to warrant a defense to the last man. Furthermore, Hitler had explicitly stated on 20 August, "If necessary, the fighting in and around Paris will be conducted without regard to the destruction of the city." Jodl therefore repeated Hitler's instructions and ordered Model to defend at Paris, not east of it, even if the defense brought devastation to the capital and its people.<sup>[30](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn29)</sup>
>
> Hitler himself left no doubt as to his wishes when he issued his famous "field of ruins" order:
>
> > The defense of the Paris bridgehead is of decisive military and political importance. Its loss dislodges the entire coastal front north of the Seine and removes the base for the V-weapons attacks against England.
> >
> > In history the loss of Paris always means the loss of France. Therefore the Fuehrer repeats his order to hold the defense zone in advance \[west\] of the city. . . .
> >
> > Within the city every sign of incipient revolt must be countered by the sharpest means . . . \[including\] public execution of ringleaders. . . .
> >
> > The Seine bridges will be prepared for demolition. Paris must not fall into the hands of the enemy except as a field of ruins.<sup>[31](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn31)</sup>
