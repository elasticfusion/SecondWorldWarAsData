> ### *The Aftermath*
>
> Paris was liberated, but one more scene was required--the appearance of General de Gaulle. He arrived unannounced in the city on the afternoon of 25 August to an enthusiastic reception by deliriously cheering Parisians. The demonstration persuaded him to make an official entry to strengthen an uneasy political unity that prevailed and to display his personal power. He therefore requested Leclerc to furnish part of the 2d French Armored Division for a parade from the Etoile to the Place de la Concorde; and through General Koenig, who was also in the capital as the de Gaullist-appointed military governor, de Gaulle invited Gerow and his staff to participate, together with one American officer and twenty men and a like number of British.<sup>[108](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn108)</sup>
>
> Gerow was hardly ready to comply. Although the situation was "quiet in main Paris area except some sniping," groups of isolated Germans southwest of Paris near Meudon and Clamart, in the eastern part near Vincennes and Montreuil, and north of Paris near Montmorency and le Bourget claimed exemption from Choltitz' surrender terms. In addition to these forces, another group still held the Bois de Boulogne.

> Furthermore, Paris posed serious problems of control, both with regard to the civilian population and to the troops, particularly because of the danger that the liberation hysteria might spread to the soldiers. The thought of a German air attack on a city with unenforced blackout rules and inadequate antiaircraft defenses hardly added to Gerow's peace of mind. The Germans north and east of the city were capable of counterattacking. Feeling that the city was still not properly secure, anticipating trouble if ceremonial formations were held, and wishing the troops combat-ready for any emergency, Gerow ordered Leclerc to maintain contact and pursue the Germans north of the capital.<sup>[109](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn109)</sup>
>
> Leclerc replied that he could do so only with part of his forces, for he was furnishing troops for de Gaulle's official entry. Acknowledging Gerow as his military chief, Leclerc explained that de Gaulle was the head of the French state.<sup>[110](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn110)</sup> Profoundly disturbed because the de Gaulle-Leclerc chain of command ignored the Allied command structure, Gerow wrote Leclerc a sharp note:
>
> > You are operating under my direct command and will not accept orders from any other source. I understand you have been directed by General de Gaulle to parade your troops this afternoon at 1400 hours. You will disregard those orders and continue on the present mission assigned you of clearing up all resistance in Paris and environs within your zone of action.
> >
> > Your command will not participate in the parade this afternoon or at any other time except on orders signed by me personally.
>
> To keep the record straight, Gerow informed Hodges that he had "directed General Leclerc to disregard those orders \[of de Gaulle\] and carry out his assigned mission of clearing the Paris area."<sup>[111](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn111)</sup>
>
> Some members of Leclerc's staff were purportedly "furious at being diverted from operations but say Le Clerq has been given orders and \[there is\] nothing they can do about \[it\]." They were sure that the parade would "get the French Division so tangled up that they will be useless for an emergency operation for at least 12 hours if not more."<sup>[112](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn112)</sup>
>
> Torn by conflicting loyalties, Leclerc appealed to de Gaulle for a decision. To an American present, de Gaulle supposedly said, "I have given you LeClerc; surely I can have him back for a moment, can't I?"<sup>[113](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn113)</sup>
>
> Although Barton suggested that Gerow might cut off Leclerc's gasoline, supplies, and money, Gerow felt that it would have been unwise, as he later wrote, "to attempt to stop the parade by the use of U.S. troops, so the only action I took was to direct that all U.S. troops be taken off the streets and held in readiness to put down any disturbance should one occur."<sup>[114](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn114)</sup>
>
> Gerow's concern was not farfetched. When Hitler learned that Allied troops were entering the French capital, he asked whether Paris was burning,

*\--620--*

<a id="page621"></a>

* * *

> "Brennt Paris?" Answered in the negative, Hitler ordered long-range artillery, V-weapons, and air to destroy the city. Supposedly contrary to Model's wish, Speidel and Choltitz later claimed to have hampered the execution of this order.<sup>[115](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn115)</sup>
>
> Scattered shooting and some disorder accompanied de Gaulle's triumphal entry of 26 August. Whether German soldiers and sympathizers, overzealous FFI members, or careless French troops were responsible was unknown, but Gerow curtly ordered Leclerc to "stop indiscriminate firing now occurring on streets of Paris." Ten minutes later, Leclerc ordered all individual arms taken from his enlisted men and placed under strict guard. Shortly thereafter, in an unrelated act, 2,600 Germans came out of the Bois de Boulogne with their hands up. They might have instead shelled the city during the parade. Frightened by what might have happened, de Gaulle and Koenig later expressed regrets for having insisted on a parade and agreed to cooperate in the future with the American command.<sup>[116](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn116)</sup>

> General de Gaulle. At his left is General Koenig, behind them, General Leclerc.

> Meanwhile, part of Leclerc's division had, in compliance with Gerow's instructions, pushed toward Aubervilliers and St. Denis on 26 August, and two days later, after a three-hour battle with elements of the *348th Division* (recently arrived from the Pas-de-Calais), the French took le Bourget and the airfield. Some French units seized Montmorency on 29 August, while others cleared the loop of the Seine west of Paris from Versailles to Gennevilliers and took into custody isolated enemy groups that had refused to surrender to the FFI.<sup>[117](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn117)</sup>
> 
> At the same time, the 4th Division had established Seine River bridgeheads near Corbeil on 25 August, had cleared the eastern part of Paris, and after assembling in the Bois de Vincennes, began on the afternoon of 27 August to advance toward the northeast. Two days later the troops were far beyond the outermost limits of Paris.<sup>[118](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn118)</sup>

> eastward, V Corps released the French division, retained command of the 4th Division, and received the 28th Infantry and 5th Armored Divisions.
>
> Developments leading to the release of the French division began on 26 August, when General de Gaulle wrote General Eisenhower to thank him for assigning Leclerc the mission of liberating Paris. He also mentioned that although Paris was "in the best possible order after all that has happened," he considered it "absolutely necessary to leave \[the division\] here for the moment."<sup>[120](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn120)</sup> Planning a visit to Paris on 27 August to confer with de Gaulle on this and other matters and "to show that the Allies had taken part in the liberation," General Eisenhower invited General Montgomery to accompany him. When Montgomery declined on the ground that he was too busy, Eisenhower and Bradley went to Paris without him.<sup>[121](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn121)</sup> At that time de Gaulle "expressed anxiety about conditions in Paris" and asked that two U.S. divisions be put at his disposal to give a show of force and establish his position. Since General Gerow had recommended that Leclerc be retained in Paris to maintain order, General Eisenhower, who earlier had thought of using Leclerc's division for occupation duty in the capital, agreed to station the French division in Paris "for the time being." To give de Gaulle his show of force and at the same time make clear that de Gaulle had received Paris by the grace of God and the strength of Allied arms, Eisenhower planned to parade an American division in combat formation through Paris on its way to the front.<sup>[122](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn122)</sup>
>
> Ostensibly a ceremony but in reality a tactical maneuver designed as a march to the front, the parade would exhibit American strength in the French capital and get the division through the city-- a serious problem because of traffic congestion--to relieve Leclerc's division.<sup>[123](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn123)</sup> While the 5th Armored Division assembled near Versailles for its forthcoming commitment, General Cota led the 28th Division down the Champs Elysées on 29 August and through the city to the northern outskirts and beyond in a splendid parade reviewed by Bradley, Gerow, de Gaulle, Koenig, and Leclerc from an improvised stand, a Bailey bridge upside down.<sup>[124](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn124)</sup>
>
> The motives behind de Gaulle's request for Leclerc's division to remain in Paris were two, possibly three. He may have wanted simply to remove friction between Leclerc and Gerow by diplomatically securing Leclerc's transfer back to Patton's Third Army. More to the point, he revealed a lack of confidence in his basic position vis-à-vis the French people. Although he had been assured on 23 August by one of his chief political advisers that "the authority of the Provisional Government of the Republic

> is recognized by the whole population," he gave at least one observer the impression that he was not entirely sure of himself politically.<sup>[125](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn125)</sup> Finally, de Gaulle did not seem to know "what to do with the F.F.I. or how best to use or control them," for since the FFI had been permitted to retain its arms, it seemed immediately after the liberation to be the "worst danger in Paris."<sup>[126](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn126)</sup>
> 
> Staffed by men of courage who had helped their country in one of the darkest periods of its history, the FFI was the single avenue for unifying all the Resistance movements and was perhaps the greatest moral force in France at the time of the liberation. Yet active resistance through the FFI had appealed to the reckless as well as to the daring. With the arrival of Leclerc's soldiers, the FFI in the capital became "a band of forgotten men." Certain more responsible members, feeling their presence no

> longer required, disappeared and resumed their normal pursuits. Others sought to exploit their weapons for personal ends. Disturbing incidents took place in the capital and the provinces, some simple disorders, others, such as the proclamation of local Soviets in isolated areas, politically inspired.<sup>[127](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn127)</sup>
>
> Koenig, anxious to relieve the situation by placing disturbing elements in uniform and thus under military discipline, asked SHAEF to furnish uniforms and equipment for 15,000 men. SHAEF complied immediately. SHAEF had earlier recognized that legal status for the FFI required the enrollment of its members in the French Army in order to provide them with a distinctive form of military dress that would distinguish them from irregular forces not entitled to the privileges and guarantees of military custom and law.<sup>[128](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn128)</sup> Using this as a lever, Koenig projected the policy by announcing that FFI members, "because of the magnificent patriotic zeal which they evinced in particular\[ly\] difficult circumstances, are naturally indicated to constitute the frame of our future Armies."<sup>[129](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn129)</sup>
>
> Such tactful circumspection was not de Gaulle's forte. Three days after , he ordered that, "beginning the 29 August 1944, the high command of the underground forces in Paris are inactivated, dissolved, and their duties will be carried out by the Commanding Generals of the different military regions." Those Resistance members liable for military service were to be regularly drafted into the Army.<sup>[130](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn130)</sup> The French War Department implemented the decision by issuing the regulations "to be applied concerning integration of the FFIs into the Army."<sup>[131](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn131)</sup> Despite criticism by extremists of the left, who declared that the action restricted the growth of a "national popular and democratic army," the Provisional Government in September passed decrees placing the FFI under French military law.<sup>[132](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn132)</sup>
>
> Although de Gaulle had wanted the 2d French Armored Division in Paris immediately after the liberation, Leclerc protested occupation duty. The division nevertheless stayed in the capital to clear the few remaining Germans and to guard bridges, military stores, and installations.<sup>[133](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn133)</sup> On 3 September, after de Gaulle apparently was satisfied with the order in the capital and the solidity of his political position, he requested General Eisenhower to remove the division from the capital for use in active operations. Five days later, the division rejoined the Third Army.<sup>[134](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn134)</sup>

> The climax of deteriorating Franco-American relations in regard to Paris occurred when General Gerow turned Paris over to the French administration. Gerow had understood that, as the senior military commander in Paris, he had responsibility for exercising control over the city during the military phase of the liberation and that he was eventually to transfer his power to General Koenig, the military governor of Paris. Yet Gerow found his authority constantly challenged by de Gaulle, Koenig, and Leclerc, to the extent that he felt impelled to request SHAEF to clarify "how far their authority extends."<sup>[135](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn135)</sup>
>
> On the second day after the liberation, General Gerow stormed into the First Army headquarters and, in the absence of the army commander, made known his troubles to General Kean, the chief of staff. "Who the devil is the boss in Paris?" he asked. "The Frenchmen are shooting at each other, each party is at each other's throat. Is Koenig the boss . . . De Gaulle . . . or am I the senior commander of troops in charge?" Assured that he was in charge, General Gerow said "All right. . . . There will be repercussions, mind you. You will have plenty of kicks--and kicks from important people, but I have a military job to do. I don't give a damn about these politicians and \[I mean\] to carry out my job."<sup>[136](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn136)</sup>
>
> There were other irritations. General Gerow was surprised to find a Communications Zone representative, Brig. Gen. Pleas B. Rogers, in the city almost immediately. He also learned that an international agreement had been made for the control of Paris, an agreement of which he had not been informed.<sup>[137](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn137)</sup> Furthermore, Koenig had arrived in Paris on 25 August and had immediately taken over civil affairs without checking with Gerow as a matter of courtesy. "So long as there was no interference on his part with tactical operations," Gerow wrote later, "I raised no objections to his action."<sup>[138](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn138)</sup>
>
> Judging the city militarily secure on 28 August, Gerow formally turned the capital over to Koenig, who flatly informed him, "The French authorities alone have handled the administration of the city of Paris since its liberation. . . . Acting as the military governor of Paris since my arrival, I assumed the responsibilities . . . the 25th of August 1944.<sup>[139](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn139)</sup> Koenig probably felt that he could not make the slightest sign that might be interpreted as admitting French dependence on the Americans. "We shouldn't blame them," General Eisenhower wrote with charity, "for being a bit hysterical."<sup>[140](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn140)</sup>
>
> Gerow turned U.S. military control in the city over to the Seine Base Section of the Communications Zone. During the early days of September, the large COMZ-ETOUSA headquarters moved from the Cotentin to Paris, a central location where adequate facilities, in contrast to those of the Cotentin, permitted

> more efficient operation. Occurring when transportation was so critical as to immobilize some combat units, the move came at an unfortunate time. Also, long before the liberation, General Eisenhower had reserved the city and its hotels, in his mind at least, for the use of combat troops on furlough. "Field forces in combat have always begrudged the supply services their rear-echelon comforts," General Bradley later wrote. "But when the infantry learned that Com Z's comforts had been multiplied by the charms of Paris, the injustice rankled all the deeper and festered there throughout the war."<sup>[141](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn141)</sup> Though Eisenhower tried to reduce the number of rear-echelon troops in the city, the military population of Paris nevertheless swelled to what seemed like unreasonable proportions.<sup>[142](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn142)</sup>
>
> One of the first impressions the liberators of Paris received was that the population appeared "healthy and full of vigor." Yet at the time of liberation only one day's supply of food was on hand for civil population.<sup>[143](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn143)</sup> "The food situation is serious," de Gaulle had wired. "The lack of coal is grave. Thanks in advance for what you can do to remedy this." "You may depend on us to do everything consistent with the military situation," the Supreme Commander replied. "Every effort is being made to rush food and coal to Paris."<sup>[144](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn144)</sup> A tremendous relief program was already under way.
>
> The greatest problem in organizing relief for Paris was transport. Bombing and sabotage had disrupted railroads, rolling stock was in short quantity, bridges had been destroyed, heavy military traffic had damaged roads. The requirements of the breakout had placed a heavy strain on motor vehicles, and gasoline was in such short supply that combat operations were about to come to a halt.<sup>[145](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn145)</sup> So serious was the lack of transport that at least one Liberty ship with food for Paris could not be accepted for discharge on the Continent.<sup>[146](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn146)</sup>
>
> To overcome these deficiencies, General Eisenhower ordered carrier planes to supplement rail and road movements. On 27 August airplanes began delivering 3,000 tons of food, medical items, and soap from the United Kingdom at the rate of 500 tons a day. General Bradley authorized a daily allocation of 60,000 gallons of fuel--gasoline or diesel--and 6,000 gallons of lubricants for vehicles delivering supplies to Paris. He also allotted 1,000 gallons of fuel oil for collective kitchens in the capital. All transportation that could possibly be spared from military requirements was made available. Two ships departed the United Kingdom on 27 August carrying 179 3/4-ton trucks, each with a trailer, to be used to get supplies to the French.

Military vehicles rushed 1,000 tons of supplies per day from British and American continental stockpiles provided for that purpose. French and captured German trucks moved several hundred tons of nearby indigenous stocks into the capital daily. Ships brought cargo from the United Kingdom for relief distribution. To offset the diminishing military stockpiles, American agricultural specialist officers were assigned to help French officials locate supplies in surplus producing areas and arrange for their delivery to the city. The French began to move cattle on the hoof to Paris.

Representatives of the two army groups and the Communications Zone co-ordinated the flow within Paris, while French authorities arranged local distribution. More than a month and a half after , French relief was still a consequential Allied military responsibility.<sup>[147](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn147)</sup>

> In retrospect, was as much a Franco-American conflict as an Allied-German struggle. The French secured almost all they wanted by convincing a reluctant, but in the end amenable, Allied command to do their bidding. The restoration of French dignity, implicit in the liberation, had come about largely through French efforts sustained by Allied complaisance. If the Allies somewhat spoiled the liberation for the French by forcing the French to share it with American troops, their motives were as pure as their impatience was typical. Regarding the prestige inherent in the liberation as small repayment for the dead Allied soldiers lost between the beaches of Normandy and the gates of the capital, the Americans were astonished when the expected French gratitude for assistance became instead a resentment and insubordination that could not be dissipated by relief supplies. Interestingly enough, the British, whether by accident or design, refrained from participating in the liberation and the ceremonies, perhaps because they regarded the liberation as primarily a French matter, possibly because they were aware of an undercurrent of anti-British feeling as a result of the destruction of the French fleet. It was unfortunate also that the man in the street confused the name of the American commander, Gerow, with that of General Henri Giraud, one of de Gaulle's political opponents, and that so overwhelmingly a de Gaullist victory in the capital could have been blemished by a simple phonetic similarity. Over the entire experience hovered the shadowy figure of Choltitz, who sought to satisfy all masters and who in the end could say that he saved Paris from destruction and could be a hero to all. No wonder, with the complications that threatened to rip the fabric of the facade of the liberation--that wonderful joy and delight of the liberated people and of civilized people everywhere, the flowers, the kisses, the songs, and the wine--no wonder it seemed cruel to expose the intrigue and bickering behind the scenes. Certainly it was simpler to believe the legend that emerged afterwards: the French Resistance in Paris had liberated the capital without outside help.<sup>[148](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn148)</sup>

Source_Link_Capture_Date:With the following specifications:

Completeness:
	- Include all paragraphs in analysis.  It's OK to group multiple paragraphs together as a single sub-event.

Specifications:
	- Prefer Grokipedia sources over Wikipedia
	- Use Wikipedia Sources whe Grokipedia has no entries.
	- Create as many unique entries as there are events and sub-events
	- [ISO 3166 Alpha-2] = ISO 3166 Alpha-2 code
	- When incorporating links to non-'https://www.ibiblio.org/' sites include current date/time of the inclusion.
	- All JSON output should be contained in a markdown code box.
TOE:
	- Unit(s) 
	- Unit_Nationality
	- Commander_Name
	- Commander_Rank
	- TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Status = Relieved, WIA or KIA:
		  -If the the commander status did not change during the event, ignore the field
		  - TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Date = last day of command
		  - List multiple commanders, if a commander is relieved, wounded or killed.
		  - Attempt to ascertain what the the unit be being discussed is attached to.  For example, a battalion might be attached to a division.  A division to a Corp.
		  - A feature of European Theater is that sub-units might be shifted around.  So they are date sensitive.
		  - Include the commander of higher unit if it can be determined.
		Biographical_reference:
			- Add a link to https://grokipedia.com/ if it exists
		  	- If not add a link to Wikipedia if it exists
	- Equipment Example:
		Name:
			- Sherman
		Identifier:
		- M4
	- Personnel: Was the unit fully staffed?
	- Supply:
		- Were there supply shortages?
Events:
	- Evaluate every paragraph, group paragraphs together as an event.
	- 'Event' is a mandatory field
	- A sub-event is classified as an event that occurs at roughly the same Place/Date and should be treated a unique entry with the same event.
	- Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn] (for example, it should document the absolute paragraph for all paragraphs in the entire $SourceLink and include all text used in analysis.
		- In the Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn], the brakets are for documentation purposes only and should not be included in the data
	- The goal of paragraph number is to be able to easily find the paragraph in the original document.
	- Never summarize Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn].
	- The goal of '"Footnote_References":' is to relate to to the original footnote.  An original footnote will be exclusively a whole number (1, 2, 3, for example)
	- Awards such as Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and Medal of Honor (MoH) should be treated as sub-events:
		- For all awards, attempt to retrieve the original citation
	- Unique Locations are sub-events
	- Unique military units mentioned are to be classified as sub-events
	- A summary of the the sub event should be included.
Place:
	- The GPS coordinates should be are close to the location as possible
	- Map_reference, is applicable when the text indicate a Map image
	Maplink:
		- See: https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/:
		- Roman Numeral identified Maps are at the section:  "Maps I-XLIII are in Inverse Order Inside Back Cover"
		- Maps with regular numbers are at the section:  "MAPS"
	ExternalMapLink: Search for maps directly related to the event/sub-event.
Weather:
	- Every Place name should have a corresponding Weather record
	- Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates example:
		- West: -180.0
		- East: 180.0
		- South: -90.0
		- North: 90.0
	- A Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates should be created using the Place.Place_GPS_coordinate as the center point and going outwards 100 kilometers.
Time and Date:
	- The "Date_group_of_event" is always as published in the text.
	- For date keep a consistent format:
		- DDHHMMZmmmYY, using the Date-time group as specified in: https://web.archive.org/web/20170321080040/http://www.gwg.nga.mil/ntb/baseline/docs/2500a/2500a.pdf
	Assumptions about Dates and Times:
		- All date times in the text are British Double Summer Time (BDST) until 15 Jul 1944
		- From 15 Jul 1944 and forward, assume British Summer Time (BST)
		- For German sourced events:
			  - Check the footnote source as to whether the source is a german document or a german post-ware interview
			  - Assume GMT+2, Central European Time (CET)
		- 'Zulu_date_group_of_event' is a conversion from BDST, BST and CET to Universal Time
	For imprecise dates and times use:
		- For imprecise dates use: "BEGINNING mmmYY" or "END mmmYY"
		- Imprecise times, use  "APPROX 240900Z mmmYY"
	For "Source_of_date_group_of_event":
		- Default to use of "Source Link: $SourceLink if it exists.
		- Use Grok to search the web for Date.Date_group_of_event if the value is empty.
		- Populate Date.Source_date_group_of_event with the source link that Grok found.

Casualties Specification:
	- KIA = Killed in Action
	- WIA = Wounded in Action
	- PoW = Prisoner of War
	- MIA = Missing in Action
	- If Casualties are unknown, set the value to '0'
Media:
	- External media confirmed to be related to the event
	- Time of media creation should be concurrent to the event
	- If there is a license associated with media, it should be noted
SourceLink: $SourceLink
Footnotes:
	- $Footnotelink
	- Be complete, analyze all footnotes
	- If an event has a footnote, follow that that link and place it into Footnote "Source:" field
	- If the footnote has a link, note the link
	- If a footnote lists multiple documents, each document should be in it's own individual JSON structure.  For example, footnote 1 references two works, the first would be 1a and the second would be 1b.
	- "Footnote" references the modified footnote number, 1a, 1b, etc...
		  - "Footnote_Number" reference the original footnote number.
	- If a footnote source lists a document, attempt to find that document online.   Only include the document is if it quoted in it's entirety or has substantial excerpts.
	- Attach footnotes to the appropriate sub-event and incorporate into the sub-event JSON stanza.
	- Award recipients, should always have an individual footnote.
	- Note that documents attributed to '"NonDigital_Library_Source": "OCMH"' have often been moved to either the National Archive or The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center (USAHEC)
	For non-Digital documents:
		- Find the library
		- The address of the of the library
		- NonDigital_Library_References is the information required to ask the library to retrieve the information
