> ### *Limited Exploitation*
>
> South of St. Gilles, CCA of the 2d Armored Division, with the 22d Infantry still attached, headed for its initial objective in the exploitation: the high ground five miles beyond St. Gilles, ground commanding an extensive network of roads leading into the COBRA zone from the east and south. There, at St. Samson-de-Bonfossé, le Mesnil-Herman, and Hill 183, the armor would find good defensive positions from which to halt a possible German counterattack from across the Vire River. To reach the area, CCA had to pass through Canisy, not quite two miles south of St. Gilles.
>
> Proceeding steadily against mortar, artillery, and antitank fire interdicting the Canisy road, CCA had more difficulty with bomb craters, mine fields, and hedgerows than with the occasional enemy resistance. In late afternoon General Rose reported opposition in his zone negligible and estimated that the rear of his column would soon clear St. Gilles.<sup>[32](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn32)</sup> Rose's optimism contributed materially to General Collins' decision to continue the corps attack during the night.
>
> Part of the reason why the opposition was negligible lay in the clearing operations of the 30th Division. Another part lay in the fact that the St. Gilles-Canisy road was the boundary separating the *LXXXIV* and II *Parachute Corps* sectors. *Panzer Lehr* was specifically responsible for the highway. The virtual destruction of *Panzer Lehr* left the road open. The 352d *Division,* manning the sector between the road and the river,

> was thus continually outflanked as Rose's combat command drove down an excellent route of advance, threatened solely by occasional flanking fire.
>
> Only as CCA neared the first buildings in Canisy was there any real resistance. At a railroad embankment north of Canisy where a bombed railway overpass had tumbled across the highway, a few Germans tried to make a stand; the combat command outflanked the position from the east and raked the defenders with enfilading fire.<sup>[33](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn33)</sup> Coincidentally, dive bombers struck Canisy and set half the town ablaze. The armor rolled through the burning town that evening.
>
> Just beyond Canisy, General Rose split his command into two columns. One moved southeastward toward St. Samson-de-Bonfossé, the other southward toward le Mesnil-Herman. Although division headquarters assumed that the combat command had halted for the night, Rose drove his men forward with single-minded purpose and determination in compliance with General Collins' and General Brooks' orders.<sup>[34](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn34)</sup> An hour before midnight one column entered St. Samson-de-Bonfossé without a fight. Three hours later the other seized the road intersection just north of le Mesnil-Herman. Only then, with part of the initial objective in hand, did General Rose sanction a halt.
>
> The next morning, 27 July, as batteries of the 14th Armored Field Artillery Battalion leapfrogged forward to give continuous fire support, the combat command engaged enemy tanks and antitank guns before taking and securing le Mensil-Herman. Hill 183 fell during the afternoon. With that, CCA completed its initial mission.<sup>[35](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn35)</sup>
>
> In two days Combat Command A had lost less than 200 men, 3 medium tanks, and 2 small trucks. Not only the weakness of the opposition but the dispatch with which General Rose had secured his objective had prevented higher casualties. Even so, Rose was not satisfied with his accomplishment; he complained that the poor condition of the roads, the absence of road bypasses, and the hedgerowed terrain had slowed his movement.<sup>[36](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn36)</sup>
>
> As General Rose prepared to reconnoiter in force toward Villebaudon and Tessy-sur-Vire on the morning of 28 July, word came that CCA's role in COBRA was over. The combat command and the attached infantry regiment were soon to pass f rom the control of the VII Corps.
>
> While General Rose's attack had moved smoothly against light opposition, General Huebner had met unexpected difficulty at Marigny on 26 July. The 1st Division, with Combat Command B of the 3d Armored Division attached, had been unable to start the main effort of the exploitation--its thrust westward from Marigny to Coutances to slash across the rear of the German troops facing north against the VIII Corps. Since the VIII Corps had begun to exert pressure from the north on 26 July, it became vital for the 1st Division to get to Coutances at once in order

*\--256--*

<a id="page257"></a>

> to execute the squeeze play that was part of the basic COBRA idea.
>
> Even though General Huebner did not possess a secure pivot point at Marigny, he felt impelled to begin his exploitation on the morning of 27 July. He ordered Colonel Boudinot's CCB to initiate the westward thrust toward Coutances. In the meantime, Colonel Smith's 18th Infantry was to attack Marigny and high ground south of the town in order to secure the road network required for sustaining the exploitation.
>
> Getting CCB on the way to Coutances conformed with the original 1st Division plan, a plan devised to employ as the axis of advance the east--west Coutances-St. Lô highway, which passes through rolling *bocage* country. West of Marigny the highway runs along the southern slope of a ridge line formed by a complex of three hills--the highest rising 580 feet--a mile or so north of the highway. This prominent terrain feature dominating the approaches to Coutances from the north and east provided an excellent natural blocking position astride the routes of withdrawal of the German forces facing the VIII Corps, and together with Coutances was the 1st Division's objective.
>
> Of the three hills forming the ridge line, the first, five miles west of Marigny, is near Camprond. The second, two miles farther to the west, is near Cambernon. The third is near Monthuchon. To General Huebner the early capture of these hills was of double importance, for they dominated also his own route of approach to Coutances.
>
> General Huebner had selected his attached armored command to spearhead the attack both because a rapid advance along the highway was essential for success of the COBRA scheme of maneuver and because the highway between Marigny and Coutances was excellent. CCB was to seize the first objective, Camprond, then the third objective, Monthuchon. Motorized infantry regimental combat teams of organic 1st Division troops were to follow in column. The 18th Infantry was to relieve CCB first at Camprond, then at Monthuchon. In turn, the reinforced 16th Infantry (Col. Frederick W. Gibb) was to relieve the 18th at Camprond. The reinforced 26th Infantry (Col. John F. R. Seitz) was to follow secondary roads on the left flank of the other units and seize the second objective, Cambernon. In the end, all three infantry regiments would be lined up on the three objectives to the rear of the German line.
>
> After being relieved at Monthuchon, CCB had a further mission, which was determined by the location of Monthuchon on the north-south Périers-Coutances highway, one of the main escape routes for Germans withdrawing before VIII Corps. The combat command was to be prepared to do one of two things: if the VIII Corps had not pushed back the Germans, CCB was to attack northward toward Périers; if the Germans were trying to escape to the south, CCB was to proceed southwestward from Monthuchon to high ground a mile or so north of Coutances in order to block the three main highways leading into Coutances from the north.<sup>[37](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn37)</sup>

> Because of the unexpected resistance at Marigny, General Huebner changed his plan of maneuver on the morning of 27 July. Since continued German possession of Marigny denied the 1st Division an adequate road net, General Huebner withheld one regiment, the 26th, in order to reduce the hazard of traffic congestion. CCB was to secure Camprond, the first objective. Instead of following the armor, the 18th Infantry was to capture Marigny, then send a battalion to free the armor at Camprond. The 16th Infantry, instead of relieving the 18th at Camprond, was to make a wider swing to the west, echeloned to the left rear of CCB, and move all the way to the blocking positions on the highways just north of Coutances. Meanwhile, CCB was to attack and secure in turn all three hill objectives.<sup>[38](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn38)</sup>
>
> The 18th Infantry cleared Marigny on the morning of 27 July, and that afternoon two battalions attacked to the south against strong opposition in an attempt to seize the high ground needed to secure the town.<sup>[39](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn39)</sup> The reserve battalion in midafternoon moved westward along the Coutances highway to relieve CCB at Camprond.
>
> Early that morning CCB had lunged down the Coutances highway.<sup>[40](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn40)</sup> Spearheaded by the reconnaissance battalion and divided into three balanced teams or task forces (a company each of medium tanks and armored infantry), the combat command advanced with two teams abreast. Against disorganized opposition, the attack carried four miles in four hours. Shortly after midday the task force on the right turned to the north and struck cross-country for the hill near Camprond, two miles away. By midafternoon the task force held the objective.
>
> The advance along the highway had been virtually a road march except for casual encounters with German motorcyclists, ambulances, and staff cars. Progress on the flanks had been more difficult, for the presence of hedgerows enabled scattered enemy groups to form hasty defenses and resist with determination. The result was a gain on a narrow front scarcely wider than the width of the highway.
>
> Moving to relieve the force at Camprond, the battalion of the 18th Infantry encountered virtually no opposition on the Coutances highway, but when it moved off the road toward the hill small enemy groups supported by random tanks began to cause trouble. With the help of fighter-bombers, the battalion gained the hill shortly before midnight.
>
> Meanwhile, the 16th Infantry, which was to make a parallel advance on the left and move swiftly to Coutances, was unable to pass through Marigny until late afternoon of 27 July. Against scattered opposition and sporadic fire, the regiment advanced in a column of battalions immediately south of the Coutances highway. Shortly before midnight the leading battalion came abreast of CCB at a point directly south of Camprond.
>
> Thus at midnight, 27 July, the 1st Division had advanced on a front not quite three miles wide to a point about five miles west of Marigny.<sup>[41](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn41)</sup> Though no

> organized enemy opposition was apparent, small enemy groups supported by an occasional tank or antitank gun formed islands of resistance, floating and static, in the American sea of advance, endangering both supply and evacuation. When twenty-one supply trucks loaded with rations, gasoline, ammunition, and military police went forward from Marigny, a company of medium tanks accompanied them to give protection. The column reached Camprond without incident, but, returning after dark with two truckloads of prisoners, the column had to fight its way back to Marigny.<sup>[42](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn42)</sup> The attempt of a reconnaissance platoon to cross the Lozon River three miles west of Marigny stimulated a counterattack by about a hundred Germans supported by a medium tank and an antitank gun. The platoon had to call for infantry and armor reinforcements from the 9th and 1st Division before dispersing the enemy group.<sup>[43](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn43)</sup>
>
> The result of the main COBRA effort produced disappointment. "Generally, we are not being able to push very fast," the VII Corps G-3 admitted.<sup>[44](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn44)</sup> General Huebner had hoped to rip into the rear of the German defense line. His troops were to have cut German telephone wires, disrupted communications, and in general produced confusion and disorganization.<sup>[45](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn45)</sup> But instead of raising havoc in a slashing exploitation, the 1st Division had not yet secured Marigny and was only half way to Coutances.
>
> The reason for the disappointing advance by the forces carrying the main COBRA effort was to be found in the German dispositions. The *LXXXIV Corps* left had made a withdrawal along the Cotentin west coast during the night of 26 July with the intention of establishing a new main line of resistance. Yet on 27 July the contemplated positions of this line were becoming untenable even before they were established because of the VII Corps threat developing west of Marigny toward the German right (east) flank. When Hausser and Choltitz suddenly became aware that American armored columns were moving through the Marigny-St. Gilles gap, they realized that they would have to move fast to avoid encirclement from the east. There was no alternative to continuing the withdrawal along the Cotentin west coast. To insure escape from encirclement, they erected a north-south defensive line facing eastward. Units manning the line included elements of the depleted *17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division,* reluctantly withdrawing paratroopers, the *353d Division,* and small elements of the *2d SS Panzer Division.*
>
> During the early afternoon of 27 July Choltitz learned that American troops--CCB of the 3d Armored Division, attached to the 1st Division--seemed to have clear sailing toward Coutances. American scouting parties on minor roads had made contact with artillery units of the *353d Division* and the *LXXXIV Corps,* and German artillerymen were fighting as infantry. Discovering also that American troops had reached Guesnay, Choltitz ordered the engineer battalion of the *17th SS Panzer*

*\--259--*

<a id="page260"></a>

* * *

> *Grenadier Division* to "proceed immediately via Montcuit and Cambernon to the railroad junction and seal off the front to the east if you are not \[now\] engaged in battle.<sup>[46](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn46)</sup>
>
> Harassed continuously by fighter-bombers, the engineer battalion marched eight miles and took positions along the railroad that night. Just to the north, the battalion found a company of the *2d SS Panzer Division* defending Cambernon with ten Panther tanks. This north-south defensive line facing eastward, though far from strong, was efficacious in slowing the 1st Division attack toward Coutances on 27 July. Farther south, hastily organized positions between Carantilly and Quibou held up another American armored column, this one driving toward Montpinchon.
>
> Hausser, meanwhile, had requested permission to withdraw the *LXXXIV Corps* to the Geffosses--St. Sauveur-Lendelin line. Soon afterward he wanted authorization to withdraw even farther, to Coutances. In both cases, he planned to make the withdrawal under the protection of the *2d SS Panzer Division,* which was moving into the Cambernon sector.<sup>[47](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn47)</sup> However, all plans were held in abeyance because Kluge, somewhat inexplicably to those in the Cotentin who awaited his advice, was inspecting the *Panzer Group West* front near Caen. Deciding they could wait no longer, Hausser and Choltitz agreed to withdraw to Coutances and hold it as the anchor point of a new line--an arc through Cambernon, Savigny, and Cerisy-la-Salle. Unfortunately for their plan, they were unaware that *Panzer Lehr* for all practical purposes no longer existed, and they were counting on *Panzer Lehr* to hold the Soulle River line at Pont-Brocard.
>
> When Kluge returned from the Caen sector late on the afternoon of 27 July, he received a detailed report of a badly deteriorating situation. The salient points were that the *353d Division* was presumed cut off and lost; the *353d Division* on the west bank of the Vire was badly battered and holding a shaky security line facing northwestward into a yawning gap; and remnants of *Panzer Lehr* and the *275th Division,* reinforced by what was hoped was a tank battalion of the *2d SS Panzer Division,* were supposedly holding a line at Quibou and westward. The Americans were running wild; details were not clear, but some troops were known to have reached the village of Dangy, near the vicinity of the *Panzer Lehr* and the *275th Division* command posts.
>
> In this situation, Hausser recommended that Kluge permit him to restore order by straightening the *Seventh Army* front. Hausser proposed to have the *II Parachute Corps* withdraw the *3d Parachute Division* (east of the Vire) "platoon by platoon" and have the *LXXXIV Corps* pull back to the banks of the Soulle and Sienne Rivers.<sup>[48](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn48)</sup> Actually, this maneuver relied on using the nonexistent *Panzer Lehr* to hold a six-mile gap between Pont-Brocard and the shaky 352d *Division* on the west bank of the Vire. Furthermore, it

*\--260--*

> counted on a tank battalion of the *2d SS Panzer Division* at Quibou that in reality had but fourteen tanks.
>
> Still primarily concerned with the Caen sector held by *Panzer Group West,* Kluge refused to countenance the withdrawal by the *II Parachute Corps,* which might expose the *Panzer Group West* flank. He instead ordered the *II Parachute Corps* to defend in place in the St. Lô--Caumont sector while the *LXXXIV Corps* anchored its forces on Coutances and executed a fighting withdrawal to the Soulles-Sienne river line. Meanwhile, he was assembling an experienced and somewhat rested armored division in the Caumont area for action in the Cotentin. Aided by whatever could be found of *Panzer Lehr,* the *275th Division,* and the *2d SS Panzer Division,* the experienced armored division was to launch a counterattack to close the gap between the *LXXXIV* and *II Parachute Corps* of the *Seventh Army.*
>
> In addition to the *9th Panzer Division,* which Kluge had requested on the previous day, he asked OKW to send a total of four infantry divisions to Normandy from the *Fifteenth* and *Nineteenth Armies.* Still concerned with the Allied threat to invade southern France, yet realizing that Kluge's situation was serious, Hitler approved release of the *9th Panzer Division* for commitment in Normandy. On the following day, 28 July, he authorized the movement to Normandy of three infantry divisions, the *84th,* the *331st,* and the *708th.<sup>[49](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn49)</sup>*
>
> Meanwhile, in the Cotentin those *LXXXIV Corps* units still north of the St. Lô-Coutances highway infiltrated south through the VII Corps column or moved around the western end of the American point during the night of 27 July. Covered by a reinforced regiment of the *2d SS Panzer Division,* which held a defensive arc from Cambernon to Savigny, the units on the Cotentin west coast continued to move south on 28 July. The units were the depleted *243d Division,* the kampfgruppe of the *265th Division,* and elements of the *77th Division* and of the *5th Parachute Division,* all apparently under the operational control of the *91st Division.* The *17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division* moved in broad daylight, though harassed from the air, to Cerisy-la-Salle in time to meet an American armored column there. At the same time the *6th Parachute Regiment,* together with *2d SS Panzer Division* tanks and the engineer battalion of the *17th SS,* covered the rear of the withdrawal and protected Coutances from positions near Ouville.
>
> These moves reflected and contributed to the changing situation. Already, on the evening of 27 July, General Bradley had altered plans by assigning General Huebner's last two objectives--Monthuchon and the high ground north of Coutances--to the VIII Corps.<sup>[50](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn50)</sup> But since Huebner saw no certainty that the VIII Corps could reach these objectives ahead of the 1st Division, he proceeded on the tentative assumption that they might still be valid for him. Huebner thus ordered a continuation of his attack on 28 July. CCB was to take Cambernon, the 16th Infantry to capture Monthuchon, the 18th Infantry to remain in the Marigny area, and the 26th

*\--261--*

<a id="page262"></a>

* * *

> Infantry to relieve CCB at Cambernon. After relief, CCB would be free to drive to the high ground north of Coutances if the VIII Corps was nowhere in evidence.<sup>[51](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn51)</sup>
>
> Developments on 28 July illustrated the discrepancy between the results of COBRA as planned and as executed. North of the St. Lô-Coutances highway, CCB met little opposition on the move toward Cambernon. After knocking out two Mark V Panther tanks with bazookas, reconnaissance troops took the objective, securing it by noon. When Colonel Boudinot asked permission to continue westward to Monthuchon, General Huebner approved after a check with General Collins. *([Map VI](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-VI.jpg%20target=))*
>
> Almost immediately word came that VIII Corps had already captured Monthuchon. Still anxious to take a part of his original objective, Boudinot ordered his troops to bypass Monthuchon and take the high ground north of Coutances. Huebner could not sanction a crossing of the north--south Périers--Monthuchon-Coutances highway because it had been reserved for the VIII Corps, and he countermanded Boudinot's order. Although reconnaissance elements were already infiltrating across the road and outposting the high ground north of Coutances, the main body of CCB stopped in time to prevent serious intermingling with the VIII Corps.[52](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/<font%20size=-1><sup><a%20name=cn%20href=#fn52) Forced to halt, the tankers could see the city of Coutances less than two miles away.
>
> Although Combat Command B had found little to obstruct its advance, the 16th Infantry, attacking westward toward Monthuchon in a zone south of the St. Lô-Coutances highway, advanced only slightly before reaching a well-organized defensive line. "Any contact with the enemy?" a division staff officer asked on the telephone. "Three hundred and sixty degree contact," came the somewhat exaggerated reply.<sup>[53](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn53)</sup> The regiment made no further progress during the afternoon, even though regimental attacks brought severe casualties and the loss of fifteen tanks, seven of them mediums. Tactical aircraft, which might have helped, were grounded because of cloudy weather.
>
> Shortly before nightfall General Huebner told CCB to go to the aid of the 16th Infantry. Turning to the southeast and attacking, the combat command pinched the rear of the enemy position. Caught in a trap, the German defense disintegrated. Before midnight CCB and the 16th Infantry made contact.
>
> Committed last, the 26th Infantry executed the 1st Division's final COBRA action. Having passed through Marigny during the morning of 28 July, it moved westward to take Cambernon. CCB's quick seizure of Cambernon and the cancellation of Monthuchon and Coutances as objectives for the VII Corps prompted General Huebner to change the regimental mission to that of sweeping the left flank of the division. Advancing through terrain infested by stragglers and remnants of German units, the 26th Infantry executed what was essentially a mop-up operation. In the early evening the leading battalion turned and faced south to exert pressure

> on the rear of German troops trapped near the village of Savigny.<sup>[54](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn54)</sup>
>
> Like CCB's shift to the south, the 26th Infantry's turn to the south was a consequence of the changing situation developing out of COBRA. According to the plan, the main battle was to have occurred in the triangular region formed on the Cotentin west coast between Lessay and Coutances by the highways from Lessay and Coutances to St. Lô. As the VIII Corps exerted pressure south from the Lessay-Périers road, the main exploiting force of the VII Corps was to have raced to Coutances to cut off German escape. "Did we lose the big fish in the trap?" a 1st Division officer asked. "Yes, probably," came the reply.<sup>[55](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn55)</sup> The division had lost two big fish: the prestige of capturing Coutances and the opportunity of trapping large numbers of Germans north of the St. Lô-Coutances highway. In three days, the division had taken only 565 prisoners.<sup>[56](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn56)</sup> The bulk of the Germans, by escaping the VII Corps main effort, had slipped through the COBRA noose. As a result, the fighting shifted to the region south of the Coutances-St. Lô highway. The 1st Division had little alternative but to face south and assume the role that the VIII Corps had earlier played, the role of a pressure force.

	- TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Status = Relieved, WIA or KIA:
		  -If the the commander status did not change during the event, ignore the field
		  - TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Date = last day of command
		  - List multiple commanders, if a commander is relieved, wounded or killed.
		  - Attempt to ascertain what the the unit be being discussed is attached to.  For example, a battalion might be attached to a division.  A division to a Corp.
		  - A feature of European Theater is that sub-units might be shifted around.  So they are date sensitive.
		  - Include the commander of higher unit if it can be determined.
		Biographical_reference:
			- Add a link to https://grokipedia.com/ if it exists
		  	- If not add a link to Wikipedia if it exists
	- Equipment Example:
		Name:
			- Sherman
		Identifier:
		- M4
	- Personnel: Was the unit fully staffed?
	- Supply:
		- Were there supply shortages?
Events:
	- Evaluate every paragraph, group paragraphs together as an event.
	- 'Event' is a mandatory field
	- A sub-event is classified as an event that occurs at roughly the same Place/Date and should be treated a unique entry with the same event.
	- Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn] (for example, it should document the absolute paragraph for all paragraphs in the entire $SourceLink and include all text used in analysis.
	- The goal of paragraph number is to be able to easily find the paragraph in the original document.
	- Awards such as Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and Medal of Honor (MoH) should be treated as sub-events:
		- For all awards, attempt to retrieve the original citation
	- Unique Locations are sub-events
	- Unique military units mentioned are to be classified as sub-events
	- A summary of the the sub event should be included.
Place:
	- The GPS coordinates should be are close to the location as possible
	- Map_reference, is applicable when the text indicate a Map image
	Maplink:
		- See: https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/:
		- Roman Numeral identified Maps are at the section:  "Maps I-XLIII are in Inverse Order Inside Back Cover"
		- Maps with regular numbers are at the section:  "MAPS"
	ExternalMapLink: Search for maps directly related to the event/sub-event.
Weather:
	- Every Place name should have a corresponding Weather record
	- Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates example:
		- West: -180.0
		- East: 180.0
		- South: -90.0
		- North: 90.0
	- A Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates should be created using the Place.Place_GPS_coordinate as the center point and going outwards 100 kilometers.
Time and Date:
	- The "Date_group_of_event" is always as published in the text.
	- For date keep a consistent format:
		- DDHHMMZmmmYY, using the Date-time group as specified in: https://web.archive.org/web/20170321080040/http://www.gwg.nga.mil/ntb/baseline/docs/2500a/2500a.pdf
	Assumptions about Dates and Times:
		- All date times in the text are British Double Summer Time (BDST) until 15 Jul 1944
		- From 15 Jul 1944 and forward, assume British Summer Time (BST)
		- 'Zulu_date_group_of_event' is a conversion from BDST and BST to Universal Time
	For imprecise dates and times use:
		- For imprecise dates use: "BEGINNING mmmYY" or "END mmmYY"
		- Imprecise times, use  "APPROX 240900Z mmmYY"
	For "Source_of_date_group_of_event":
		- Default to use of "Source Link: $SourceLink if it exists.
		- Use Grok to search the web for Date.Date_group_of_event if the value is empty.
		- Populate Date.Source_date_group_of_event with the source link that Grok found.
Casualties Specification:
	- KIA = Killed in Action
	- WIA = Wounded in Action
	- PoW = Prisoner of War
	- MIA = Missing in Action
	- If Casualties are unknown, set the value to '0'
Media:
	- External media confirmed to be related to the event
	- Time of media creation should be concurrent to the event
	- If there is a license associated with media, it should be noted
SourceLink: $SourceLink
Footnotes:
	- $Footnotelink
	- If an event has a footnote, follow that that link and place it into Footnote "Source:" field
	- If the footnote has a link, note the link
	- If a footnote lists multiple documents, each document should be in it's own individual JSON structure.  For example, footnote 1 references two works, the first would be 1a and the second would be 1b.
	- If a footnote source lists a document, attempt to find that document online.   Only include the document is if it quoted in it's entirety or has substantial excerpts.
	- Attach footnotes to the appropriate sub-event and incorporate into the sub-event JSON stanza.
	- Award recipients, should always have an individual footnote.
	- Note that documents attributed to '"NonDigital_Library_Source": "OCMH"' have often been moved to either the National Archive or The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center (USAHEC)
	For non-Digital documents:
		- Find the library
		- The address of the of the library
		- NonDigital_Library_References is the information required to ask the library to retrieve the information
