> ### *The German Task*
>
> In planning a counterattack to regain Avranches and restabilize their Normandy defenses, the Germans had to stiffen their resistance in order to preserve the conditions under which a counterattack was possible. If the defensive line east of Avranches were lost, regaining Avranches would avail little. At the same time, the assembly areas for the forces that were to launch the counterattack had to be protected. To accomplish these tasks was to prove difficult, for the Germans had relatively few troops in Normandy at the beginning of August. *(See [Map IX](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-IX.jpg).)*

> Losses had been exceedingly high among the divisions in contact with the Allies during June and July. Hausser, the *Seventh Army* commander, counted eight divisions that had practically been destroyed in the Cotentin during the month of July alone: *Panzer Lehr, 5th Parachute, 17th SS Panzer Grenadier,* and *91st, 352d, 275th, 243d,* and *77th Infantry Divisions.*<sup>[8](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn23.html#fn8)</sup> This did not take into account the *16th Luftwaffe Field Division* and the *326th Division,* annihilated near Caen and Caumont, respectively. It did not include the divisions in Brittany and on the Channel Isles that had to be written off as far as the Normandy front was concerned: the *2d Parachute,* the *343d* and *319th Infantry Divisions,* and parts of the *265th* and *266th.* Nor did it mention that the *21st, 9th SS, 10th SS,* and *12th SS Panzer Divisions* had been badly crippled in the Caen and Caumont sectors. Only a few divisions of Eberbach's *Fifth Panzer Army,* the weak *3d Parachute* and *353d Divisions* (the latter temporarily presumed lost during COBRA and now reduced to kampfgruppe size) of Hausser's *Seventh Army,* and the armored divisions scheduled to launch the Avranches counterattack still retained combat effectiveness. Like all the troops in Normandy, these too had suffered from

> Two infantry divisions were scheduled to reinforce the battered units holding the Normandy left flank and also to relieve the armored divisions scheduled to counterattack. The *363d* moved through Tinchebray during the first days of August and into the Brécey-Vire line to relieve the *2d* and the *2d SS Panzer Divisions* by 5 August.<sup>[10](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn23.html#fn10)</sup> The *84th,* supposed to relieve the *116th Panzer Division,* was committed on 2 August in defense of the Sourdeval sector and became engaged in such violent combat that it was unable to accomplish the relief as quickly as hoped.
>
> Despite heavy pressure exerted by the First U.S. Army, the *Seventh Army* managed, by stubborn resistance and skillful withdrawal, to retain a defensive line that, while not solid, was at least cohesive. The *XLVII Panzer Corps* headquarters gave up responsibility for the center to prepare for the counterattack, and the *77 Parachute* and the *LXXXIV Corps* together fought along the Brécey-Vire line. On the right (east), the *II Parachute Corps,* controlling only the *3d Parachute Division* (reinforced by a regiment of the *5th Parachute Division)* defended the town of Vire. On the left, the *LXXXIV Corps* had the more complicated job of getting the armored divisions out of the line without upsetting the precarious defensive balance. In this the corps depended heavily on the kampfgruppe of the *353d Division.* On the extreme left, under *LXXXIV Corps* control, remnants of the *5th Parachute* and *275th Divisions* held weak blocking positions south of the Sée River near Juvigny.<sup>[11](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn23.html#fn11)</sup>

> During the first week of August, five factors gave the German commanders pause. First, they often doubted that they could prevent the counterattack assembly areas from being overrun. Second, they wondered whether the transfer of armored divisions (the *2d* and the *116th* at the end of July, and the pending transfer of the *1st SS* in August) from Eberbach's forces would so weaken the right wing that the British and Canadians would be able to effect a penetration south of Caen. Third, they were aware of the threat of encirclement by coordinated British and American drives to the town of Flers--the British by a continuation of the southeastward thrust from Caumont, the Americans by a northeastward thrust from Fougères through Domfront. Fourth, they were concerned with the threat to the *Army Group B* rear posed by American forces driving toward le Mans. Fifth, they worried that loss of high ground around Mortain--excellent terrain from which to launch offensive action--might inhibit the counterattack toward Avranches. These thoughts added to the burdens of the holding battle immediately preceding the counterattack.<sup>[12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn23.html#fn12)</sup>
