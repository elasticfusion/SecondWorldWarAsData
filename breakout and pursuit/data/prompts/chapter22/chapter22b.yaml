> ### *Commitment of a Corps*
>
> While the Germans thus made their decision and laid their plans, the Americans, who were exploiting the Avranches gap, were also coming to a decision that was to alter the OVERLORD plan. The first move in the new direction of what was to be a profound change lay in the circumstances of the commitment of the XV Corps.
>
> Commanded by Maj. Gen. Wade H. Haislip, a West Pointer who had fought in France during World War I and had recently been the Assistant Chief of Staff, G-1, on the War Department General Staff, the XV Corps headquarters had arrived on the Continent near the middle of July as a Third Army component. Because the single mission accorded the Third Army in early planning was securing Brittany and its ports, and because XV Corps was to become operational immediately upon commitment of the Third Army, it was expected that XV Corps would share the Brittany mission with VIII Corps. Yet the situation created by COBRA raised doubt as to the need of two corps in Brittany; thus the exact role of the XV Corps remained undefined except for projected commitment near Avranches.<sup>[12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn12)</sup> There was even doubt about the divisions the corps would control. Though the 4th Armored Division had been tentatively assigned to XV Corps, it was well employed as part of VIII Corps. To give XV Corps an armored force, Patton promised that if the 4th could not be made available, the recently arrived and assembled 5th Armored Division would be assigned. Because the 35th and 5th Infantry Divisions, also slated to come under the XV Corps, were in the V Corps sector, far from Avranches, it seemed more convenient to use the 83d and 90th Divisions, which had been pinched out near Périers. Trying to be ready for any eventuality, General Haislip alerted the 83d and 90th Division commanders to their possible assignment to the corps while at the same time keeping a close check on

> the 4th Armored "so that intelligent orders for it to side-slip into \[the\] zone of XV Corps" could be issued promptly. On 1 August Haislip learned that he was to control the 5th Armored, 83d, and 90th Divisions, but this too was to be changed.<sup>[13](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn13)</sup>
> 
> Where the XV Corps was to be employed was also somewhat a matter of conjecture. Early plans had projected a XV Corps advance along the north shore of Brittany, but at the end of July a zone on the left of VIII Corps seemed more probable. Since the immediate Third Army objective was the Rennes-Fougères area, it was reasonable to expect the XV Corps to be directed on Fougères as a preliminary for a subsequent advance to the southwest toward Quiberon. Early on 1 August, General Haislip learned that "the projected operation of the Corps toward the southwest had been cancelled, and that \[a\] new operation would be \[started\] towards the southeast."<sup>[14](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn14)</sup>
> 
> The reason for the change lay in the constriction and vulnerability of the Avranches bottleneck. To prevent German interference with American troop passage, a protective barrier was necessary. To ameliorate traffic congestion, a wider corridor was desirable. To attain these ends became the first combat mission of XV Corps, and to achieve
> 
> it the corps was to enter the gap between the diverging VIII and VII Corps. On 1 August the VIII Corps left flank extended almost to Rennes, while the VII Corps right flank reached for Brécey and beyond. Although the distance between Rennes and Brécey provided more than adequate room for the new corps, the few miles between Avranches and Brécey presented a problem. The approach march in particular was bound to be difficult, for units of XV Corps would have to pass through the already congested rear areas of the two adjacent corps.<sup>[15](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn15)</sup>
> 
> Although General Haislip wanted to move his armored component to the fore immediately in order to exploit German disorganization, traffic congestion was so bad that after two days the 5th Armored Division was still north of the Sée River.

> There, the armor was temporarily halted to conform with new instructions from the army group commander, General Bradley.<sup>[16](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn16)</sup> Fortunately, the 90th Division was able to take over the first corps assignment of moving to Avranches and eastward to take blocking positions between the Sée and the Sélune Rivers.<sup>[17](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn17)</sup> *([Map 12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-12.jpg))*
>
> The 90th Division's reputation at the beginning of August was still somewhat blemished. The division's part in the battle of the hedgerows during July had done little to alter the general impression that the 90th was far from being combat effective, and there had been talk of breaking it up to provide replacements for other units.<sup>[18](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn18)</sup> However, under a new commander, Brig. Gen. Raymond S. McLain, the 90th was to have another chance to make good.
>
> General McLain's first mission was to capture St. Hilaire-du-Harcouët, a town on the Sélune River not quite fifteen air miles southeast of Avranches. Possession of a Sélune River bridgehead at St. Hilaire would widen the Avranches corridor and establish an anchor point for blocking positions east of the coastal bottleneck. With St. Hilaire in hand, McLain was to set up a defensive line north to the Sée River to block enemy movement westward between the Sée and the Sélune.<sup>[19](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn19)</sup>

> A task force under the command of Lt. Col. George B. Randolph was to screen the movement of a larger force under Lt. Col. Christian E. Clarke, Jr., that was to spearhead the division advance.<sup>[20](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn20)</sup> The leading units began to move an hour before midnight, 1 August. Although traffic was heavy and the troops had a "tough time" moving during darkness, Task Force Randolph swept aside a small number of enemy rear guards and on the morning of 2 August reached St. Hilaire. The main bridge was still intact. When Task Force Clarke arrived, the artillery took defiladed positions, other support units built up a base of fire, and an infantry skirmish line followed by light tanks charged across several hundred yards of open ground and crossed the bridge in the face of enemy shelling. The troops quickly eliminated the halfhearted resistance in the town. So rapid and aggressive had the assault been that casualties were few. With St. Hilaire in hand, General McLain brought the remainder of the 90th Division forward to a line north of the town in order to establish contact with the VII Corps at Juvigny, thus erecting a barrier against German attack from the east.<sup>[21](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn21)</sup> The performance of the division at St. Hilaire was far different from that in the Cotentin and augured well.
>
> As the 90th Division consolidated in the area east of Avranches, General McLain received an order from General Haislip to extend his defensive line seven miles from St. Hilaire south toward Fougères to the village of Louvigné-du-Désert. In compliance, Task Forces Randolph and Clarke occupied Louvigné shortly after midnight, 2 August.<sup>[22](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn22)</sup> By this advance, the XV Corps adequately covered the VII Corps right flank.
>
> Though the VII Corps right flank was thus protected by the advance of the XV Corps, the VIII Corps--then making the main American effort--had its left flank open between Louvigné and Rennes, a 35-mile gap covered only by patrols of the 106th Cavalry Group.<sup>[23](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn23)</sup> To remedy the situation, General Patton, just before noon on 2 August, ordered General Haislip to move the 5th Armored Division south to Fougères, the hub of an important road network. To Haislip, Patton's order not only pertained to flank protection for the VIII Corps but also indicated that XV Corps was about to embark on a campaign of exploitation.<sup>[24](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn24)</sup>
>
> As events developed, Haislip was in for disappointment. About the same time that Patton decided to cover the exposed VIII Corps flank, General Bradley, the army group commander, was visiting General Middleton's command post. Also concerned about the corps flank, Bradley and Middleton decided to send a strong force to Fougères at once.

> The only unit immediately available for this mission was the 79th Division, whose leading regiment was already at Pontorson on a projected move to follow the 6th Armored Division westward to Brest. Reversing the direction of the 79th Division "pursuant to instructions of army group commander," Middleton ordered occupation of Fougères before dark, 2 August, and establishment of contact with the 90th Division at Louvigné-du-Désert.<sup>[25](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn25)</sup> It was this set of instructions from General Bradley that prompted the halt of the 5th Armored Division north of the Sée River.<sup>[26](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn26)</sup>
>
> Patton had acted simultaneously with Bradley to close the gap, the difference being the choice of the unit. Sending the 79th instead of the 5th Armored brought quicker action at Fougères and lessened traffic congestion around Avranches, but it also temporarily brought some complications to both the VIII and the XV Corps. The 79th Division replaced the 83d on the corps troop list, and the immediate result was some confusion: the XV Corps headquarters had "no wire to either division--90th Inf Div has no wire to anybody--79th Inf Div seems to have wire (only) to VII Corps"; and the 83d Division for a short time was simultaneously attached to two corps--VIII and XV--that were going in opposite directions.<sup>[27](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn27)</sup> Yet the shift was made with relative ease, primarily because uniformity of training and of staff procedures throughout the U.S. Army gave units flexibility. Throughout the campaign a brief telephone call was enough to set into motion an apparently complicated change.
>
> To secure Fougères, reconnaissance troops of the 79th Division moved on the heels of a 106th Cavalry Group patrol into the town. The division occupied Fougères in force on the morning of 3 August and established contact with the 90th Division on the north.<sup>[28](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn28)</sup> As the 106th Cavalry Group (assigned to the XV Corps) continued to screen the area between Fougères and Rennes, apprehension over the VIII Corps left flank vanished.<sup>[29](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn29)</sup> The VIII Corps drove westward into Brittany, but the XV Corps, in contrast with earlier OVERLORD plans, faced to the southeast.
>
> The orientation of XV Corps to the southeast reflected the reaction of the American high command to the changed situation brought about by the breakout. The 90th Division on the left and the 79th on the right held a defensive line from Juvigny to Fougères, facing away from Brittany, while the 5th Armored Division prepared to move south through Avranches toward the corps right flank.<sup>[30](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn30)</sup> In a sense, it was a fortuitous deployment that was to prove fortunate. For as the corps reached these positions, thinking on the higher echelons of command crystallized. The result altered a basic concept of the OVERLORD planning.
