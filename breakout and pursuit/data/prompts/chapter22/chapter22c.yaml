> ### OVERLORD Modified
>
> In the midst of the fast-moving post-COBRA period, the utter disorganization of forces on the German left flank contrasted sharply with unexpected firmness in other parts of the German line. To exploit the collapse on the German left and to deal with continuing tenacity elsewhere, the Allied command seized upon the southeastern orientation of the XV Corps.
>
> In the post-COBRA exploitation during the last days of July, when General Bradley had directed XIX Corps to advance along an axis projected through Tessy, Vire, and Domfront to Mayenne, Bradley thought the XV Corps might advance toward the upper reaches of the Sélune River, pinch out the VII Corps at Mortain, and meet the XIX Corps at Mayenne.<sup>[31](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn31)</sup> Unfortunately, XIX Corps had not gotten much beyond Tessy by 3 August. In contrast, XV Corps had met no "cohesive enemy front" in moving to the St. Hilaire-au-Harcouët-Fougères-Rennes line, and the 79th Division reported no enemy contact at all at Fougères.<sup>[32](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn32)</sup> To exploit this contrasting situation was tempting.
>
> Preinvasion OVERLORD and NEPTUNE planners had expected the early Allied effort to be directed toward Brittany unless the Germans had decided to withdraw from France or were at the point of collapse, and actual operations during June and July had conformed to this concept. Since the Germans appeared on the verge of disintegration at the beginning of August, the Allies began to consider the bolder choice offered by the planners: an immediate eastward drive toward the principal Seine ports of Le Havre and Rouen.<sup>[33](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn33)</sup>
>
> The NEPTUNE planners had visualized the Allied right in Normandy making a wide sweep south of the *bocage* country, and as early as 10 July General Montgomery had suggested a maneuver of this kind eastward toward the successive lines Laval-Mayenne and le Mans-Alençon. Several days before COBRA and again several days after COBRA, Montgomery had reiterated this concept: he wanted the First U.S. Army to wheel eastward while the Third Army was occupied with operations in Brittany.<sup>[34](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn34)</sup>
>
> During the latter days of July, when 21 Army Group planners considered in detail the bountiful advantages that might accrue from capture of Avranches, they were impressed by three opportunities that seemed immediately and simultaneously feasible: seize the Breton ports, destroy the German *Seventh Army* west of the Seine River, and cross the Seine before the enemy could organize the water line for defense. Thus assuming that the ground forces were about to fulfill the objectives of the OVERLORD plan, the Allies began to think seriously of post-OVERLORD operations directed toward the heart of Germany.

> Occupying the OVERLORD lodgment area had always implied possession of

> the Breton ports, one of the most vital strategic objectives of the OVERLORD plan, before winter weather precluded further use of the invasion beaches. Now the planners were confident that a small force, one American corps of perhaps an armored division and three infantry divisions, "might take about a month to complete the conquest." The remainder of the Allied forces could turn to the other, more profitable opportunities: "round up" the Germans west of the Seine, drive them against the river, destroy them within the limits of the lodgment area, and, by seeking such distant objectives as Paris and Orléans, prepare to cross the Seine River.<sup>[35](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn35)</sup>
>
> These speculations slighted a fundamental factor that had governed OVERLORD planning until that time: the belief that the Allies needed the Breton ports before they could move outside the confines of the lodgment area. Montgomery's planners had weighed the logistical merits of gaining Brittany against the tactical opportunities created by COBRA and by arguing for the latter presented a radically different conclusion. Until that moment the importance of the Breton ports could hardly have been exaggerated, for the very success of OVERLORD had seemed predicated on organizing Brittany as the principal American base of operations.<sup>[36](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn36)</sup>
>
> General Eisenhower reflected the changing attitude toward the question of Brittany on 2 August. He believed that "within the next two or three days" Bradley would "so manhandle the western flank of the enemy's forces" that the Allies would create "virtually an open \[enemy\] flank," and he predicted that the Allies would then be able to exercise almost complete freedom in selecting the next move. He would then "consider it unnecessary to detach any large forces for the conquest of Brittany," and would instead "devote the greater bulk of the forces to the task of completing the destruction of the German Army, at least that portion west of the Orne, and exploiting beyond that as far as \[possible\]." He did not mean to write off the need for the Breton ports, but securing both objectives simultaneously, he believed, would now be practical.<sup>[37](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn37)</sup>
>
> On the same day, 2 August, General Bradley was still thinking along the lines of the original OVERLORD plan. Patton's forces then entering Brittany were still executing the American main effort, and the entire Third Army was eventually to be committed there to secure the ports. The St. Hilaire-du-Harcouët-Fougères--Rennes line, in the process of being established by the XV Corps, was no more than a shield to prevent interference with the Third Army conquest of the Brittany peninsula.<sup>[38](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn38)</sup> On the following day, 3 August, Bradley changed the entire course of the campaign by announcing that Patton was to clear Brittany with "a minimum of forces"; the primary American mission was to go to the forces in Normandy who were to drive eastward and expand the continental lodgment area.<sup>[39](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn39)</sup> Brittany had

> become a minor prize worth the expense of only one corps. "I have turned only one American Corps westward into Brittany," General Montgomery stated on the following day, "as I feel that will be enough."<sup>[40](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn40)</sup> Had logistical planners not insisted that the ports were still needed, even fewer forces might have been committed there.<sup>[41](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn41)</sup> Several days later, when heavy resistance had been discovered at the port cities, Montgomery resisted "considerable pressure" to send more troops "into the peninsula to get the ports cleaned up quickly," for he felt that "the main business lies to the East."<sup>[42](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn42)</sup>
>
> The new broad Allied strategy that had emerged concentrated on the possibility of swinging the Allied right flank around toward Paris. The sweeping turn would force the Germans back against the lower reaches of the Seine River, where all the bridges had been destroyed by air bombardment. Pushed against the river and unable to cross with sufficient speed to escape, the Germans west of the Seine would face potential destruction.<sup>[43](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn43)</sup>
>
> Because the XV Corps was already around the German left and oriented generally eastward, General Haislip drew the assignment of initiating the sweep of the Allied right flank. The remaining problem was to resolve from somewhat conflicting orders the exact direction in which Haislip was to move-south, southeast, or east.<sup>[44](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn22.html#fn44)</sup>
