```
> While the XV Corps left part of its forces at Argentan and started the wider envelopment to the Seine on 15 August, other components of the Third Army farther to the south were also driving to the Seine, sweeping clear the vast area north of the Loire River. The advance to the Seine fulfilled a prophecy made a week earlier--that "the battle of Normandy is rapidly developing into the Battle of Western France."<sup>[1](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn1)</sup>
>
> ### *South to the Loire*
>
> The drive to the Seine had actually begun on 3 August, when General Bradley instructed General Patton to secure the north-south line of the Mayenne River, clear the area west of the Mayenne River as far south as the Loire, and protect the 12th Army Group south flank with minimum forces.<sup>[2](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn2)</sup> Since the VIII Corps was driving southwest toward Rennes and the XV Corps was about to move southeast toward Mayenne, Patton oriented the XX Corps south toward Nantes and Angers. As the main American effort veered eastward in accordance with the modified OVERLORD plan and the XV Corps drove toward Laval and le Mans, Patton ordered the XX Corps to cross the Mayenne River in a parallel drive to protect the XV Corps south flank.<sup>[3](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn3)</sup>
>
> Bradley approved Patton's eastward orientation and even furthered it by designating the Paris-Orléans gap as the ultimate Third Army objective. Yet he specified once more the additional mission of protecting the south flank along the Loire River to guard against possible German incursion from the south. Angers and Nantes would therefore have to be captured.<sup>[4](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn4)</sup> *(See Maps [12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-12.jpg) and [17](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-17.jpg).)*
>
> The demands of this dual mission became the responsibility of Maj. Gen. Walton H. Walker, a West Pointer who had served in France during World War I, who had been an infantryman and artilleryman before turning to armor, and who had commanded the IV Armored Corps, later redesignated the XX Corps, in training.
>
> Early plans for XX Corps to control the 2d French Armored and the 5th and 35th Infantry Divisions went awry when the 35th became involved in the Mortain counterattack and when the French division, after a brief alert for possible action at Mortain, joined the XV Corps. The 5th Division thus remained the sole instrument available for the XX Corps initial commitment.

> 11th Infantrymen *meet resistance in the drive to Angers.*
> 
> Having fought with the V Corps before being pinched out on the First Army left flank near Vire, General Irwin's 5th Division received instructions an hour before dawn on 4 August to join the XX Corps by moving immediately through Villedieu and Avranches to an assembly area near Vitré, forty miles south of Avranches. The suddenness of the call precluded advance planning, and General Irwin felt handicapped by a lack of definite knowledge of his next combat mission and the terrain in which he would fight. With no inkling that this manner of operating would soon be normal, General Irwin began at once to march from one American flank to the other.<sup>[5](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn5)</sup>
> 
> On the road for three days in a march hampered by traffic congestion, the 5th Division reached Vitré on 7 August. On that day Patton orally instructed Walker to move a regiment of the 5th Division to seize Angers, fifty-five miles southeast of Vitré; an infantry battalion

> to capture Nantes, sixty-five miles southwest of Vitré; and the rest of the division to Segré, twenty-two miles northwest of Angers. Gaffey, Third Army chief of staff, arrived at Irwin's command post at noon that day to transmit the mission for quick compliance. Though tired from their long hours on the road, the 5th was to move at once. Perhaps Gaffey was not explicit, perhaps Irwin misinterpreted. In any event, Irwin felt that the fifty-mile distance between Nantes and Angers, as well as the distance of both towns from Vitré, made it impractical for him to take both objectives at the same time. The development of the major operations to the east and Patton's instructions for Walker to reach the Mayenne River south of Château-Gontier seemed to give Angers priority over Nantes.<sup>[6](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn6)</sup>
>
> Information on the enemy in the area south and east of Vitré was scant, but "a general withdrawal by the Germans, extent and destination not yet clear," was presumed. Actually, there were scarcely any Germans between Vitré and the Loire River. The *First Army* in southwest France had been charged on 2 August with protecting the crossing sites along the Loire River, its northern boundary. Two days later the *LXXX Corps* artillery commander brought a measure of unified leadership to the troops along the river line from St. Nazaire to Saumur--security formations, naval personnel, antiaircraft units, and the like. On 8 August, the *16th Division* (formed by consolidating the *158th Reserve Division--*which was intended originally to furnish replacements to the units committed in Normandy--and the *16th Luftwaffe Field Division)* assumed responsibility for defending the Loire along a front that eventually extended from Nantes to Orléans. The *16th Division* was short of equipment but was well trained and well led.<sup>[7](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn7)</sup> Part of this force, with some few elements that had come from Normandy, met the 5th U.S. Division at Angers, a city of 95,000 inhabitants located just south of the point where the Mayenne and Sarthe merge to become the Maine River. The Maine, only six miles long, flows through Angers before joining the Loire. Three miles south of Angers, a highway bridge crosses the Loire at les Ponts-de-Cé.
>
> From Vitré, General Irwin dispatched Col. Charles W. Yuill's 11th Infantry through Cande in a direct approach to Angers from the west. He sent a company-sized task force on a more devious route to cross the Mayenne and Sarthe Rivers, outflank Angers on the east, cut the main highway south of the city, and capture the bridge across the Loire.<sup>[8](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn8)</sup> The small task force soon discovered that all bridges across the Sarthe and Mayenne in the division zone were demolished and that few Germans were between Château-Gontier and the Loire. The force then retraced its steps and rejoined the division, which in the meantime had displaced to Angers behind the 11th Infantry. The nth had encountered no serious resistance until reaching a point two miles west of Angers on the evening of 7 August. General Irwin

> had then moved the remainder of the division south from Vitré.
>
> Impatient, General Walker phoned Irwin at noon, 8 August. Walker wanted Angers quickly, but he also wanted a reinforced infantry battalion sent to Nantes. If German activity at Lorient, Brest, and St. Malo indicated a pattern of behavior likely to be encountered at all the ports, it was reasonable to assume that strong and determined German forces held Nantes. Although his available troops permitted him only to contain the enemy in the area, Walker desired at least a token force to block the northern exits of Nantes and prevent the Germans from sallying forth unnoticed against American communications.
>
> Irwin, who was already involved at Angers, his major objective, wanted to keep his units well consolidated so he could deal with any emergencies. Operating in what he considered a vacuum of information, he was uneasy because his "mission, zone of action, and adjacent forces \[were\] not clear," even though he was "using every agency" to find out what his neighbors were doing. Nevertheless, when he learned at the end of the afternoon of 8 August that Walker was "much exercised" because no troops were on the way to Nantes, Irwin sent out a call for trucks. They arrived early on 9 August, and a reinforced infantry battalion motored to Nantes. Encountering no opposition until reaching the outskirts of the city, the battalion destroyed a telephone center and a radio station, then set up blocking positions along the city's northern exits.
>
> Meanwhile, the 11th Infantry on 8 August had captured intact a railroad bridge southwest of Angers, and this gave direct access into the city. General Irwin funnelled Col. Robert P. Bell's 10th Infantry across the bridge on 9 August and prepared a co-ordinated two-regiment attack for the following day.
>
> General Walker visited the division and was satisfied with the preparations, but he characteristically "urged more speed in attack." Launched on 10 August, the drive carried American troops into the city, and, by the morning of 11 August, the 5th Division had almost two thousand prisoners and was in control of Angers. American aircraft destroyed the highway bridge south of the city by bombardment, thus isolating Angers from the south.<sup>[9](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn9)</sup>
>
> Developments elsewhere had their effect on the XX Corps. On the basis of information that German reinforcements were moving into the le Mans-Alencon-Sées area, Third Army on 11 August directed Walker to assemble on the Mayenne-le Mans line three of the four divisions then assigned to him. With the 7th Armored, 35th, and 80th Divisions, he was to attack promptly from the Mayenne-le Mans line to the northeast to secure the Carrouges--Sées line. The intention apparently was to eliminate a potential German threat from the west against the exposed left and rear of the

*\--562--*

> XV Corps, which was driving north toward Argentan. In addition, Walker was directed to move the 5th Division, less a regiment to be left at Angers, northeast along the Loir River about fifty miles from Angers to a line generally between le Mans and Tours, there, as Patton put it, "to guard against a very doubtful attack on our \[south\] flank."<sup>[10](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn10)</sup>
>
> The 7 th Armored Division, which had recently landed at Omaha Beach and was hurrying toward le Mans, was not immediately available, nor was the 35th Division, engaged at Mortain. But so urgent was the need to cover the exposed left flank of the XV Corps that Walker, directed again on 12 August to attack, initiated action on the 13th with the two regiments of the 80th Division at hand. Though the attack made good progress and swept away scattered German resistance, it ended in embarrassment as the 80th Division troops collided with XV Corps units moving across their attack zone.<sup>[11](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn11)</sup>
>
> Meanwhile, the 5th Division was moving northeast from Angers. To General Irwin, who was less than fully informed on the big picture, "sudden and unexpected changes cause\[d\] considerable confusion in arrangements, transportation, and plans," particularly since there was "no indication of reasons for orders." His bewilderment increased during the next few days when orders "made no sense at all" and prompted "great confusion."
>
> Between 12 and 16 August, Irwin received conflicting orders that indicated not much more than changing directions of march. Strained communications, sketchy information, and a surprising absence of German opposition characterized his division's movements, and he could only guess that his ultimate objective might be Dreux, Châteaudun, or Orléans. In time, General Walker told him to remain south of the Chartres-Etampes highway. Finally Walker advised him to stand fast just south of Chartres. Irwin then assumed that he was "heading south of Paris to the east," but he hoped for a few days rest so that his troops could take care of long-needed mechanical maintenance.
>
> Meanwhile, a 4th Armored Division combat command had relieved the battalion of the 5th Division at Nantes, and the 319th Infantry of the 80th Division had replaced Colonel Roffe's 2d Infantry, which Irwin had temporarily left at Angers. As these components joined the division near Chartres, Irwin again had a complete unit, and he would soon get a definite mission.<sup>[12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn28.html#fn12)</sup>
