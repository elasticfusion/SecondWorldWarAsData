    > ### *Envelopment from the North*
    > 
    > Twenty-four hours after the Germans counterattacked toward Avranches, the First Canadian Army, from positions three miles south of Caen, launched a massive attack southeast toward Falaise. The timing was accidental, but it could hardly have been more fortunate.
    > 
    > The Canadian attack had been in preparation for almost a week, its object at the least to wear down enemy units, at the most to unhinge the German withdrawal to the Seine that General Montgomery expected.[1](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn1) The German thrust toward Avranches, changing the situation, widened Montgomery's perspective on the role of the Canadian effort. The Canadian attack now became his main instrument of destruction.
    > 
    > The Canadians were to "break through the German positions astride the road Caen-Falaise," and advance toward Falaise, twenty-one miles southeast of Caen.[2](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn2) For the first fifteen miles the road was "arrow-straight," rising "gradually, sometimes almost imperceptibly, but steadily," from little more than sea level to more than six hundred feet in height. "Up this long, smooth, dangerous slope the Canadians were to fight," across acres of waving wheat broken by an occasional village, a patch of woods, an occasional orchard--through an area where only an infrequent hedgerow or belt of trees lined the side roads.[3](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn3)
    > 
    > The ground was good for employing armor, but solidly built villages and the woods provided defenders excellent natural centers of resistance. Three German divisions--the *272d* and *89th Infantry* and the *12th SS Panze*r--manned two defensive lines in depth. Fifty 88-mm. antiaircraft pieces, sited for antitank action, supplemented about sixty dug-in tanks and self-propelled guns.
    > 
    > To overcome these strong defenses, General Crerar decided to combine overwhelming air support with ground penetration under the cover of darkness. After a strike by heavy bombers, tanks were to lead the attack. Infantrymen riding in armored personnel carriers (self-propelled gun carriages specially converted for troop transport by Lt. Gen. G. G. Simonds, the corps commander, and later called Kangaroos), were to follow the tanks and detruck at appropriate points to mop up.

    > An hour before midnight, 7 August, more than a thousand RAF planes were ready to blast bomb zones flanking the projected ground assault area, and fighter-bombers were prepared to loose more than 5,000 tons of bombs on the assault area. Even though darkness, weather, smoke, and dust made visibility so poor that only two-thirds of the planes dropped their loads, the bombardment was more effective than that in Operation GOODWOOD, less than three weeks earlier.[4](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn4) On the ground, 720 artillery pieces were available to shell the enemy and light the battlefield with flares. While Bofors fired tracer bullets to mark the direction of the attack and searchlights provided "artificial moonlight," two divisions moved out shortly before midnight. Preceded by tanks with flailing mechanisms to detonate enemy mines and by engineers who were to establish routes through German mine fields, eight columns of armor (each with four vehicles abreast) moved toward Falaise.
    > 
    > Dense clouds of dust mixed with ground mist obscured vision. Although the assault troops crawled in low gear at one hundred yards a minute, collisions occurred and units lost their way. Yet the confusion that enveloped the attackers was less than that covering the defenders. By dawn of 8 August the Canadians had gained their first objectives; they had penetrated the German lines for a distance of three miles.
    > 
    > Off to a good start, the attack bogged down as the Canadians struck a solid line of defense, a "lay-back position."[5](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn5) To break through, the Canadians committed two fresh but inexperienced armored divisions, one of which was the 1st Polish Armored Division.[6](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn6) At that point everything seemed to go wrong. The new divisions displayed the usual shortcomings of green units. An air attack, delivered by bombers flying across the front and moving progressively forward like a creeping barrage, killed 25 men and wounded 131 (including a division commander), mostly Polish troops. Although the ground attack continued through 8 and 9 August for a gain of five more miles, momentum then ceased. The attack had carried the Canadian Army eight miles forward, but the same distance still separated it from Falaise.[7](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#f7n)
    > 
    > Meanwhile, the Second British Army, attacking since 30 June from positions south of Caumont, continued to exert pressure while turning between Thury-Harcourt and Vire southeastward toward Falaise and Flers. The original idea of the offensive was to pivot the line in order to keep pace with the Americans; later the purpose was changed to deny the enemy time to organize a withdrawal to the Seine; and finally, after the Mortain counterattack, to crush the German forces that were trying to hold the north flank of the counterattack toward Avranches.

    > Despite the changing purpose of the offensive, the attack itself continued relentlessly, grinding down the *LXXIV Corps* and making necessary its reinforcement by elements of the II *SS Panzer Corps.* British forces pushed through a region not particularly suited for offense, an area of rough terrain devoid of good roads. It was a slow, hard advance, destitute of glamor and newspaper headlines, but it was inexorable, and it increased German concern over the way the situation was developing.[8](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn8)
