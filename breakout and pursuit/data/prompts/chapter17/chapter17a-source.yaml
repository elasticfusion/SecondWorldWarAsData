> ### *The Riesensauerei*
>
> "It's a madhouse here," Kluge cried in despair as he attempted to describe the situation on the morning of 31 July.
>
> At the *Seventh Army* command post in le Mans, Kluge for the second day was for all intents and purposes commanding the *LXXXIV Corps* and the *Seventh Army,* in addition to performing his official duties as commander of *Army Group B* and *OB WEST.*
>
> "You can't imagine what it's like," he told General der Infanterie Guenther Blumentritt, the *OB WEST* chief of staff, on the telephone. "Commanders are completely out of contact \[with their troops\]. Jodl and Warlimont \[Hitler's chief advisers at OKW\] ought to come down and see what is taking place."
>
> Who was to blame? The whole mess had started, it seemed to Kluge, "with Hausser's fatal decision to break out to the southeast. So far, it appears that only the spearheads of various \[American\] mobile units are through to Avranches. But it is perfectly clear that everything else will follow. Unless I can get infantry and antitank weapons there, the \[left\] wing can not hold."
>
> Apropos of that, Blumentritt said, OKW wanted to know the locations of all the alternate and rearward defenses under construction in Normandy.
>
> Kluge did not hide his derision. "All you can do is laugh out loud," he replied. "Don't they read our dispatches? Haven't they been oriented? They must be living on the moon."
>
> "Of course," Blumentritt agreed smoothly.
>
> Kluge's mood changed. "Someone has to tell the Fuehrer," he said, without designating who was to perform the unpleasant task, "that if the Americans get through at Avranches they will be out of the woods and they'll be able to do what they want."
>
> The terrible thing, Kluge said, was that there was not much that anyone could do. "It's a crazy situation."<sup>[1](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn17.html#fn1)</sup>
>
> At 0030 on 31 July, Kluge had authorized the *Seventh Army* to withdraw to a line from Granville to Troisgots.<sup>[2](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn17.html#fn2)</sup> Thirty minutes later he was trying to get the *LXXXIV Corps* back still farther, to the Avranches-Villedieu-les-Poëles line, but without much success--for his messages were not getting through. At this time Kluge admitted unequivocably that his left flank had collapsed.<sup>[3](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn17.html#fn3)</sup>

> <a id="page324"></a>At 0920 Kluge learned definitely that the Americans were in Avranches, but other than that the entire situation in the Avranches-Villedieu sector was "completely unclear." The only facts that could be accepted with assurance were that German losses in men and equipment were high and that U.S. fighter-bomber activity was "unprecedented." An "umbrella" of planes had covered American tanks advancing on Granville and Avranches. The responsibility for the crisis, he insisted, lay with Hausser's order for the left wing of the *LXXXIV Corps* to attack to the southeast. He had discovered that Choltitz had protested Hausser's order, and he felt that this futile protest absolved Choltitz from blame for the subsequent disaster. Troops under the control of the *91st Division* had established a thin line from Bréhal to Cérences as early as 28 July, but the American penetration on 31 July near Cérences had "ripped open the whole western front." The inevitable conclusion was that "Villedieu, springboard for movement east and south, is the anchor-point for Brittany, \[and\] has to be held under all circumstances or else has to be recaptured."[4](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn17.html#fn4) But Kluge could do no more than draw conclusions; without an organized front and without adequate communications, he was powerless to influence the course of events.
>
> Fifteen minutes later, Kluge's greatest worry was still Villedieu. He did not know nor could he find out which side held the town. Suspecting the worst, he agreed to let the *XLVII Panzer Corps* pull back the *2d* and *116th Panzer Divisions* to the Villedieu-Percy line. He knew that east of the Vire River, in the withdrawal toward the town of Vire, the *II Parachute Corps* had lost the greater part of the *3d Parachute Division* (including the *15th Parachute Regiment* attached to it). He knew also that the *21st Panzer Division,* the last reserve division in Normandy, had been committed on the left flank of *Panzer Group West,* where the *326th Infantry Division* had been overrun by the British.<sup>[5](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn17.html#fn5)</sup>
>
> Satisfied that he could do little on the front east of Avranches except hope for the best, Kluge set out to block the Americans at Avranches. At first he thought he could bring up two infantry divisions--the *84th* and *89th--*to deal with the small armored spearheads there, but he soon realized that the divisions could not possibly arrive in time.<sup>[6](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn17.html#fn6)</sup> He then turned to the forces in Brittany.
>
> Since early on the morning of 31 July, when Kluge first faced the difficult and distasteful conclusion that the front was disintegrating, he had tried to get troops to hold the bridge near Pontaubault.<sup>[7](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn17.html#fn7)</sup> Unsuccessful in this effort, he took the drastic step of stripping the Brittany defenses by ordering Fahrmbacher, who commanded the *XXV Corps* in Brittany, to denude the St. Malo area of forces in order to prohibit the influx of Americans into Brittany. Specifically, Fahrmbacher was to send all available mobile troops to hold the Pontaubault bridge and from there to launch

> <a id="page325"></a>Fahrmbacher was handicapped in two respects. Though there were many unemployed naval and air force troops in his corps sector, he could not order them to assume ground force missions because they were not under his jurisdiction. The troops directly under his control and therefore available to him were generally of two types--static troops guarding the coast line and units that had escaped from the Cotentin after taking heavy losses. Both lacked sufficient transport to make them mobile. Fahrmbacher felt that he could not perform his mission at Avranches, but he tried anyway.[8](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn17.html#fn8)
>
> Fahrmbacher dispatched toward Pontaubault what remained of the *77th Division,* a unit perhaps the equivalent of a battalion in strength, reinforced by assorted paratroopers and a company of assault guns. This force, under Col. Rudolf Bacherer, the *77th Division* commander, reached the vicinity of Pontaubault in the late afternoon of 31 July, only to find the Americans already there.<sup>[9](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn17.html#fn9)</sup>
>
> Hours before this took place, Kluge had reported to Hitler through Warlimont that he did not think it at all possible to stop the Americans, who had broken out of the strong static defenses that had contained them in July.<sup>[10](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn17.html#fn10)</sup> Hitler's "stand fast and hold" tactics, it appeared, had failed.
