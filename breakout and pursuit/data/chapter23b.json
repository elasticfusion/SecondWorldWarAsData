Hausser, the *Seventh Army* commander, counted eight divisions that had practically been destroyed in the Cotentin during the month of July alone: *Panzer Lehr, 5th Parachute, 17th SS Panzer Grenadier,* and *91st, 352d, 275th, 243d,* and *77th Infantry Divisions.*<sup>[8](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn23.html#fn8)</sup> This did not take into account the *16th Luftwaffe Field Division* and the *326th Division,* annihilated near Caen and Caumont, respectively. It did not include the divisions in Brittany and on the Channel Isles that had to be written off as far as the Normandy front was concerned: the *2d Parachute,* the *343d* and *319th Infantry Divisions,* and parts of the *265th* and *266th.* Nor did it mention that the *21st, 9th SS, 10th SS,* and *12th SS Panzer Divisions* had been badly crippled in the Caen and Caumont sectors. Only a few divisions of Eberbach's *Fifth Panzer Army,* the weak *3d Parachute* and *353d Divisions* (the latter temporarily presumed lost during COBRA and now reduced to kampfgruppe size) of Hausser's *Seventh Army,* and the armored divisions scheduled to launch the Avranches counterattack still retained combat effectiveness. Like all the troops in Normandy, these too had suffered from --442-- uninterrupted combat, inferior equipment, inadequate materiel and supplies, and Allied air superiority. Though the men were still fighting grimly, commanders were concerned lest the will to resist suddenly vanish.<sup>[9](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn23.html#fn9)</sup>"

        "Paragraph_16": "During the first week of August, five factors gave the German commanders pause. First, they often doubted that they could prevent the counterattack assembly areas from being overrun. Second, they wondered whether the transfer of armored divisions (the *2d* and the *116th* at the end of July, and the pending transfer of the *1st SS* in August) from Eberbach's forces would so weaken the right wing that the British and Canadians would be able to effect a penetration south of Caen. Third, they were aware of the threat of encirclement by coordinated British and American drives to the town of Flers--the British by a continuation of the southeastward thrust from Caumont, the Americans by a northeastward thrust from Fougères through Domfront. Fourth, they were concerned with the threat to the *Army Group B* rear posed by American forces driving toward le Mans. Fifth, they worried that loss of high ground around Mortain--excellent terrain from which to launch offensive action--might inhibit the counterattack toward Avranches. These thoughts added to the burdens of the holding battle immediately preceding the counterattack.<sup>[12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn23.html#fn12)</sup>"
