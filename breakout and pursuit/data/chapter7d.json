      "Sub-event_summary": "Between 7 and 10 July 1944, the Germans reinforced the Taute-Vire sector with elements from the 2d SS Panzer Division and planned a major counterattack using the Panzer Lehr Division to prevent an American breakthrough.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_34": "While the Germans defended stubbornly and adroitly in the zones of the VII and VIII Corps, they directed their greatest effort against the XIX Corps between the Taute and Vire Rivers. This was the sector where the 30th Division and Combat Command B of the 3d Armored Division were attacking toward the high ground west of St. Lô. If the U.S. troops reached their objective, the Germans reasoned, they might unhinge the German line in the Cotentin and outflank not only those units defending la Haye-du-Puits and Périers but also the II Parachute Corps in the St. Lô-Caumont sector. To reinforce Kampfgruppe Heinz and the small portion of the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division resisting between the Taute and the Vire, the II Parachute Corps sent part of its reserves, light forces organized around a mobile brigade, to close the gap opened by the American attack. But these troops were obviously too few to dissipate the danger of a serious breakthrough, and the 2d SS Panzer Division consequently added a tank-infantry task force, which attacked the American flank on 9 July.",
        "Paragraph_35": "Deciding two days earlier that they needed a strong force between the Taute and the Vire, Kluge and Rommel obtained the Panzer Lehr Division from the Panzer Group West front in order to mount a major counterattack."

      "Sub-event_summary": "On 8-10 July 1944, the 9th Division was deployed along the east bank of the Taute River to outflank German resistance and protect the XIX Corps flank, assuming control of additional units.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_37": "General Corlett on 8 July had sent Combat Command A of the 3d Armored Division across the Vire to reinforce the 113th Cavalry Group on the right flank. Adding further to the strength of the already considerable force in the XIX Corps bridgehead, and arriving accidentally in time to meet the attack of Panzer Lehr, came the 9th Division, the unit that General Collins had been unable to employ with the rest of his VII Corps on the Carentan-Périers isthmus. Upon General Hodges' suggestion, General Collins persuaded General Bradley on 8 July that committing the unemployed 9th Division along the east bank of the Taute River would fulfill two useful functions. By outflanking the German resistance on the Carentan-Périers isthmus, the division would help the VII Corps and provide strong protection to the XIX Corps right flank. Bradley decided that the 9th Division's attack would be related more properly to the VII Corps action than to the XIX Corps advance toward St. Lô, so he let Collins retain control of the division. Moving the VII Corps boundary to the east and giving Collins a slice of the XIX Corps zone, General Bradley split the Taute and Vire area between the VII and XIX Corps, the new boundary to be effective as soon as the 9th Division crossed the Vire et Taute Canal and was ready to attack. General Collins ordered the division to attack westward--between the canal on the north and the St. Jean-de-Daye--le Désert road on the south--toward the Taute River. After making contact with the 83d Division, the 9th was to turn south to cut the Périers-St. Lô highway.",
        "Paragraph_38": "The 9th Division was thoroughly battle trained. It had participated in the North African invasion and the Sicilian campaign and in June had played a prominent part in the capture of Cherbourg. General Eisenhower considered it one of the two he rated \"tops\" in the European theater.",
        "Paragraph_39": "The division commander, Maj Gen. Manton S. Eddy, had organized his headquarters in a fashion that resembled German practice. So that he might be free to visit the line units, Eddy kept the assistant division commander at the command post to make emergency decisions and to supervise the \"operational group\"--the G-2 and G-3 Sections--while the chief of staff supervised the \"administrative group\"--the G-1 and G-4 Sections.",
        "Paragraph_40": "The division had considerable potential fire power and mobility. In addition to controlling two extra battalions of artillery, one light and one medium, the 9th Division assumed control of Combat Command A of the 3d Armored Division and also of the 113th Cavalry Group. To keep the mobile armor and cavalry available for emergency use, General Eddy planned to hold them in reserve. At first he would employ his three infantry regiments abreast, attacking westward toward the Taute. The 9th Division crossed the Vire et Taute Canal on 9 July and was ready on the following morning to meet again the challenge of fighting in the hedgerows. A preparation by dive-bombers and artillery preceded the attack. Two regiments met opposition immediately and to their consternation advanced but several hedgerows. The third regiment had better success clearing the corner formed by the juncture of the Taute River and the Vire et Taute Canal. Resistance was light and enemy artillery conspicuous by its silence. A reconnaissance patrol, however, moving toward Tribehou Island in the Taute River flats, was turned back by mortar and machine gun fire. That night, as the 9th Division reorganized for attack on the morning of 11 July, enemy fire increased and small groups of tanks and infantry attempted to infiltrate the lines. German tank motors sounded in the distance. From just beyond the division positions came the noise of infantrymen digging in. The 9th Division staff officers depreciated these signs, for they believed that the Germans were merely covering preparations for a general withdrawal during the night. Although the 30th Division on the left reported heavy enemy traffic moving toward the Taute River, the 9th Division staff preferred to accept as more valid an announcement from the 4th Division that the enemy was falling back. This judgment coincided with the view held at First Army headquarters. The army G-2 had interpreted the noisy march across the American front by Panzer Lehr, which had repeatedly broken radio silence en route, as a demonstration of German bluff, an action presaging in reality a general withdrawal."

      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_41": "The Germans were not bluffing. Generalleutnant Fritz Bayerlein, the commander of Panzer Lehr, had received his march order on 8 July and had moved at once, though poor roads and strafing by Allied planes had hampered the division march. Not until the night of 10 July was the division in position to attack--too late, Rommel thought. Kampfgruppe Heinz, which had suffered approximately 30 percent casualties and had virtually disintegrated as an organized unit, was withdrawn to the southwest as artillery of the 17th SS Panzer Grenadiers gave covering fire and the 30th Mobile Brigade and the tank-infantry teams of the 2d SS Panzer Division launched local counterattacks. Hausser, the Seventh Army commander, attached these elements to Panzer Lehr, visited the division command post, and talked over the details of the attack with Bayerlein. With Rommel pushing for speed, Panzer Lehr was to attack at once--that night.",
        "Paragraph_42": "Bayerlein planned to attack with two regimental combat teams abreast. The regiments were to converge on the St. Jean-de-Daye crossroads from the southwest and the south. With the high ground at the crossroads in his possession, he would have command of the American crossing sites over the canal and the river, north and east of St. Jean-de-Daye. Hoping that the night attack would easily achieve a breakthrough, Bayerlein envisioned the infantry riding tanks to the objective. The II Parachute Corps was to launch a feint directly north from St. Lô in a limited objective attack along the east bank of the Vire River.",
        "Paragraph_43": "The jump-off was scheduled for 0145, 11 July. Unfortunately for Panzer Lehr, Combat Command B of the 3d Armored Division in driving toward Hauts-Vents had jostled and delayed the leading panzer elements getting ready to attack. Still in firm possession of Hauts-Vents, Panzer Lehr jumped off just before dawn, 11 July, after a short artillery preparation. The routes of attack passed on both sides of CCB. The regiment on the right, moving close to the Vire River through Pont-Hébert, aimed for the Airel bridge and struck the 30th Division. The regiment on the left, moving through le Désert, struck the 30th and 9th Divisions."

Two hours later the fact that Germans were making noise, were firing a great deal, and appeared \"to be all around now\" occasioned little more than nonchalance mixed with some incredulity. Not until the division artillery reported some confusion because German infantrymen were approaching the gun positions did the staff realize that a counterattack was under way. About the same time an infantry infantry battalion command post was overrun. As reports began to indicate that enemy tanks were throughout the division area, telephone lines from all the regiments went out. Still the situation did not seem serious enough to wake the division commander.",

The penetrations prompted confusion and some withdrawal before subordinate American commanders could begin to control their troops in close-range fighting. After daylight brought some amelioration of the confusion, and after wiremen by 0900 had restored communications to the regiments, General Eddy got a coordinated defense into action. Infantrymen cut behind German spearheads to seal routes of withdrawal, while tanks, tank destroyers, and infantry bazooka teams stalked the isolated enemy armor."

By the middle of the afternoon of 11 July, the 9th Division had contained the enemy attack. General Eddy was then able to launch his own counterattack and regain ground abandoned earlier in the day. Because of the possibility of further enemy armored action, Eddy established a strong defensive line, giving particular attention to antitank precautions. The 9th Division had sustained little more than a hundred casualties. The only effect of the Panzer Lehr effort was to delay the 9th Division attack twenty-four hours."

At a roadblock on a secondary route, guards heard tanks approaching, but were told by higher headquarters that American tanks were in the vicinity. The men let a column of tanks and infantry pass before noticing that the soldiers in the column were speaking German. They immediately alerted troops in the rear who engaged the column with antitank rifles and bazookas. Individual groups of infantrymen spontaneously and with little coordination or direction destroyed five enemy tanks and four armored scout cars, two of the latter mounting flame throwers. Machine guns emplaced earlier that evening for all-around security fired into the ranks of enemy infantry. As the night exploded into sound and flash, the noise of withdrawing tanks gradually became discernible.

In the morning it was obvious that the point of the enemy armored column had been blunted and the main body forced to withdraw. At the same time, units of the 30th Division near the west bank of the Vire River were repelling the other regimental column of Panzer Lehr. Before noon of 11 July, U.S. troops had contained the enemy attack in that area and had cleared German stragglers from the division rear.",

The effect of the Panzer Lehr attack was not confined to the front line. At the still inadequate crossing sites over the Vire, military policemen had been driven from their traffic control posts by the increased enemy shelling. Traffic quickly coagulated. To relieve the congestion and reduce the possibility of embarrassment if a direct shell hit destroyed a bridge, a Bailey bridge was erected and completed late on 12 July; it took somewhat longer than normal because of continuing German fire."
