      "Sub-event_summary": "At midnight on 15 July 1944, General Bradley shifted the corps boundaries, assigning VII Corps control of the area between the Taute and Vire Rivers, with the 9th Division to clear the east bank of the Taute and advance south, the 30th Division to advance to the Périers-St. Lô road and then east, and the 3d Armored Division in reserve.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_51": "Delayed by both the Panzer Lehr counterattack and a combination of enemy and terrain, the 9th and 30th Divisions still were short of fulfilling their missions when a new factor emerged to modify General Bradley's earlier split of the Taute and Vire River area. As his new plan to get out of the Cotentin approached maturity, the ground near the Périers-St. Lô highway became a vital necessity. To make possible a joint effort by the 9th and 30th Divisions toward the new objective--the Périers-St. Lô highway--General Bradley shifted the corps boundaries again. At midnight on 15 July, General Collins' VII Corps relinquished the Carentan-Périers isthmus to the VIII Corps and assumed control of the area between the Taute and the Vire.",
        "Paragraph_52": "The 9th Division on the right was to clear the east bank of the Taute River and advance south. The 30th Division on the left was to advance south to the Périers-St. Lô road, then turn east to secure the high ground west of St. Lô. The 3d Armored Division, in reserve, was to be committed as needed. The 330th Infantry, detached from the 83d Division and temporarily attached to the 9th Division, was to clear the east bank of the Taute River between the Vire et Taute Canal and the Tribehou causeway. The 330th was then to be pinched out and returned to the 83d Division."

Panzer Lehr, after its unsuccessful counterattack, was being moved into the line to relieve the 352d Division, which was to be shifted to a quiet sector. The 2d SS Panzer Division was to be relieved for rehabilitation. The Germans thus expected to hold their positions with fewer troops. The U.S. attack on 15 July was not entirely a surprise to the Germans, who had noted the movement of the 9th Division across the Vire et Taute Canal and had deduced the general American intention. But the Germans had not expected the attack so soon, and the troops in the line were still not completely reorganized."

The Germans were apparently still in possession of Tribehou Island in the Taute flats, and the causeway was still in enemy hands. To secure the causeway and clear the island, the 9th Division on 16 July committed a battalion of the 330th Infantry. Supported by artillery and dive-bombers, the battalion crossed the causeway and cleared Tribehou Island by evening. The 330th Infantry was pinched out and reverted to 83d Division control.

The 60th Infantry took its objective on 15 July, but the 47th Infantry, in the center, met resistance at le Hommet and le Mesnil-Veneron that halted the regiment a mile short of the causeway. On the left, the 39th Infantry reached the river bank, but the 330th Infantry was stopped by fire from across the Taute and could not advance. The Germans were apparently still in possession of Tribehou Island in the Taute flats, and the causeway was still in enemy hands. To secure the causeway and clear the island, the 9th Division on 16 July committed a battalion of the 330th Infantry. Supported by artillery and dive-bombers, the battalion crossed the causeway and cleared Tribehou Island by evening. The 330th Infantry was pinched out and reverted to 83d Division control.

      "Sub-event_summary": "The 39th Infantry Regiment of the 9th Division, with the 330th attached, cleared the east bank of the Taute River to the Tribehou causeway on 15-16 July 1944, and advanced along the east bank when turning south.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_54": "The 9th Division attacked with three regiments abreast. The 60th Infantry on the right advanced toward the Taute River flats to secure the high ground overlooking the Tribehou causeway. The 47th Infantry in the center cleared the banks of the Vire et Taute Canal to the Tribehou causeway. The 39th Infantry on the left, with the 330th Infantry attached, cleared the east bank of the Taute River as far south as the Tribehou causeway, where the 330th Infantry was to be pinched out.",
        "Paragraph_55": "The 9th Division attack began well. The 60th Infantry took its objective on 15 July, but the 47th Infantry, in the center, met resistance at le Hommet and le Mesnil-Veneron that halted the regiment a mile short of the causeway. On the left, the 39th Infantry reached the river bank, but the 330th Infantry was stopped by fire from across the Taute and could not advance. The Germans were apparently still in possession of Tribehou Island in the Taute flats, and the causeway was still in enemy hands. To secure the causeway and clear the island, the 9th Division on 16 July committed a battalion of the 330th Infantry. Supported by artillery and dive-bombers, the battalion crossed the causeway and cleared Tribehou Island by evening. The 330th Infantry was pinched out and reverted to 83d Division control. The 39th Infantry cleared the east bank of the Taute to the causeway, and the 47th Infantry reached the causeway.",
        "Paragraph_56": "The 9th Division then turned south. The 60th Infantry on the right advanced along the high ground overlooking the Taute River flats. The 47th Infantry in the center moved south along the canal. The 39th Infantry on the left advanced along the east bank of the Taute River. The division made good progress on 17 July, but on the following day ran into strong resistance from the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division, reinforced by the 6th Parachute Regiment. The Germans had organized a strong defensive line along the Périers-St. Lô road, and the 9th Division could not break through. On 19 July the division was halted and began to prepare for the forthcoming COBRA operation."
