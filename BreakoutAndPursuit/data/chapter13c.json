      "Sub-event": "Decision to commit armor on 26 July",
      "Sub-event_summary": "General Collins committed armored forces on 26 July despite incomplete infantry objectives at Marigny and St. Gilles to accelerate the breakthrough in a three-corps offensive, with all air support assigned to VII Corps. To avoid congestion, only two armored columns were committed instead of three.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_18": "For the Americans, the critical day of the COBRA operation was 26 July, when General Collins had gambled. He committed some of his forces assembled for the exploitation before the situation was unquestionably ripe for an exploitation maneuver. Specifically, the infantry had not captured the towns of Marigny and St. Gilles, road centers considered prerequisite to an uninhibited exploitation by mobile armored reserves.",
        "Paragraph_19": "The fact that COBRA on 26 July was to become a three-corps offensive actually made it impossible for General Collins to wait for the infantry to seize Marigny and St. Gilles. The success of the larger effort depended basically on a VII Corps breakthrough. Emphasizing this fact, General Bradley assigned to VII Corps all the air support available on 26 July, thus obliging Collins to step up the attack. The only way to do this was to commit the armor.",
        "Paragraph_20": "The basic gamble involved was the possibility that armored columns would congest the VII Corps battlefield. \"The only doubtful part of it [the original COBRA plan] to my mind,\" General Collins had said two weeks earlier, \"is we shouldn't count too much on fast movement of armored divisions through this country; if we make a break-through it is OK but until them . . . [the armored divisions] can't move any faster than the infantry.\"",
        "Paragraph_21": "To minimize congestion, General Collins called upon only part of his reserve, two armored columns instead of the three that were ready."

Now a semi-administrative road march of this type was out of the question. The commanders replaced their reconnaissance units with assault troops and retained their artillery under centralized control rather than parceling it out to subordinate combat teams."

        "Paragraph_25": "Clearing the road to Marigny became the responsibility of Maj. Gen. Clarence R. Huebner, who commanded the 1st Infantry Division and the attached Combat Command B of the 3d Armored Division. Alerted on the afternoon of 25 July to pass through the 9th Division the next day and capture Marigny, General Huebner ordered CCB (Col. Truman E. Boudinot) and the reinforced 18th Infantry (Col. George Smith, Jr.) to attack abreast astride the road. Not quite certain whether the 1st Division, which had motorized its infantry troops, was embarking on exploitation, a VII Corps staff officer in a routine telephone call to transmit the bomb safety line remarked somewhat facetiously that his message was unnecessary if \"you are going someplace and are going fast.\"",
        "Paragraph_26": "General Huebner, who commanded one of the two divisions General Eisenhower had characterized as \"tops\" in the theater, was planning to go somewhere fast all right. He hoped to take Marigny quickly and proceed at once to exploit westward from Marigny to Coutances.",
        "Paragraph_27": "The 1st Division made its approach march to the vicinity of the Périers-St. Lô highway during the night of 25 July without incident. Shortly after daybreak, 26 July, the leading units bypassed an enemy pocket of 150 men still north of the COBRA line of departure. Leaving the reduction of this small force to the reserve battalion of the 18th Infantry, the advance troops drove toward Marigny.",
        "Paragraph_28": "With the combat command on the right (west) of the road and the infantry regiment on the left, the 1st Division troops moved cautiously against small arms fire. Bomb craters in the roads and defended hedgerows bounding the fields were the principal deterrents to a rapid advance. Small roadblocks also slowed the attack. Artillery and tank fire eliminated most of the opposition, but only after the infantry components had received heavy casualties, particularly among key personnel.",
        "Paragraph_29": "Near Marigny, the troops encountered the increasing resistance of the 353d Division and the two companies of the 2d SS Panzer Division. Several Mark IV tanks and a few 75-mm. antitank guns north of the town halted progress early in the afternoon. Under cover of an extended tank fire fight, CCB attempted an envelopment to the right but achieved no success. A tactical air strike late in the afternoon enabled armored elements to reach the northern edge of the town; the enveloping forces buttoned up for the night about a mile west of Marigny."

        "Paragraph_30": "The presence of American tanks in the northern outskirts of Marigny and the abortive envelopment led the 18th Infantry to the erroneous belief that the combat command had taken the town. Acting on this mistaken impression, the regiment sent a battalion to bypass the town on the east during the evening and take high ground south of Marigny. The battalion took some high ground shortly before midnight and reported completion of its mission. Unfortunately, the battalion had become lost in the darkness; not only was it on the wrong objective, its actual location was a mystery.",
        "Paragraph_31": "The belief that Marigny had been captured was one of the factors leading to General Collins' order to continue the attacks during the night of 26 July. Specifically, Collins instructed General Huebner to commence his exploitation toward Coutances. To provide additional elbow room for the 1st Division, General Collins redrew the boundary between the 1st and 9th Divisions.",
        "Paragraph_32": "General Huebner for his part dared not carry out the order. He was not sure exactly where all his front-line units were, for reports of their locations and dispositions had confused his headquarters throughout the day; he was not certain that his troops had really secured Marigny; he was concerned by continuing resistance near Marigny; and, finally, he feared that large-scale movement during darkness would promote congestion and confusion.",
        "Paragraph_33": "Still without Marigny after two days, the VII Corps had yet to launch its main exploiting effort westward to Coutances. As discouraging as this seemed to be, the success achieved on the other flank of the corps was quite the opposite."

        "Paragraph_34": "On the left (east) flank, Maj. Gen. Edward H. Brooks, commanding the 2d Armored Division, had what was essentially a protective mission: guarding the COBRA flank on the south and southeast. Yet if General Brooks realized that his mission was defensive in nature, he gave no indication of it. So far as he was concerned, he was going to move. With the 22d Infantry (Col. Charles T. Lanham) attached, he was to attack in a column of combat commands, which eventually were to split and make independent thrusts. Brig. Gen. Maurice Rose's Combat Command A, with the 22d Infantry attached, was to be the leading unit.",
        "Paragraph_35": "Rose's troops were to pass through the 30th Division zone and secure St. Gilles. Effecting the passage of lines without difficulty, CCA drove south early on 26 July in a single column.",
        "Paragraph_36": "Almost immediately after the troops crossed the Périers-St. Lô highway, an enemy antitank gun destroyed one Sherman, but this was a blow not soon repeated. Brooks told Rose to get moving, and Rose complied. As the column began to roll, only scattered artillery and antitank fire and an occasional defended hedgerow or ditch provided any genuine resistance. When combined with the problem of bomb craters dotting the countryside, this was nevertheless sufficient to preclude a rapid advance. In the early afternoon a defended roadblock several hundred yards north of St. Gilles held up progress for a short time, but tank fire and an air strike that destroyed four Mark IV tanks and a self-propelled gun soon eliminated the opposition."

        "Paragraph_38": "Troops Rolling Through Canisy Limited Exploitation South of St. Gilles, CCA of the 2d Armored Division, with the 22d Infantry still attached, headed for its initial objective in the exploitation: the high ground five miles beyond St. Gilles, ground commanding an extensive network of roads leading into the COBRA zone from the east and south. There, at St. Samson-de-Bonfossé, le Mesnil-Herman, and Hill 183, the armor would find good defensive positions from which to halt a possible German counterattack from across the Vire River.",
        "Paragraph_39": "To reach the area, CCA had to pass through Canisy, not quite two miles south of St. Gilles. Proceeding steadily against mortar, artillery, and antitank fire interdicting the Canisy road, CCA had more difficulty with bomb craters, mine fields, and hedgerows than with the occasional enemy resistance. In late afternoon General Rose reported opposition in his zone negligible and estimated that the rear of his column would soon clear St. Gilles.",
        "Paragraph_40": "Rose's optimism contributed materially to General Collins' decision to continue the corps attack during the night.",
        "Paragraph_41": "Part of the reason why the opposition was negligible lay in the clearing operations of the 30th Division. Another part lay in the fact that the St. Gilles-Canisy road was the boundary separating the LXXXIV and II Parachute Corps sectors. Panzer Lehr was specifically responsible for the highway. The virtual destruction of Panzer Lehr left the road open. The 352d Division, manning the sector between the road and the river, was thus continually outflanked as Rose's combat command drove down an excellent route of advance, threatened solely by occasional flanking fire."

Since the VIII Corps had begun to exert pressure from the north on 26 July, it became vital for the 1st Division to get to Coutances at once in order to execute the squeeze play that was part of the basic COBRA idea.",

He ordered Colonel Boudinot's CCB to initiate the westward thrust toward Coutances. In the meantime, Colonel Smith's 18th Infantry was to attack Marigny and high ground south of the town in order to secure the road network required for sustaining the exploitation.",

West of Marigny the highway runs along the southern slope of a ridge line formed by a complex of three hills--the highest rising 580 feet--a mile or so north of the highway.
