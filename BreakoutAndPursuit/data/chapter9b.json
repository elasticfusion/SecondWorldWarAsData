        "Paragraph_46": "To the Germans, even more than to the Americans, the July operations had been hard. Only the skillful defensive tactics in the hedgerow terrain plus the pattern of the American offensive had averted complete disintegration of the German defenses in Normandy. The successive nature of the American corps attacks had enabled the Germans to shift units from one threatened portion of the front to another, a course of action perhaps impossible had the First Army been able to launch simultaneous attacks all across the front.",
        "Paragraph_47": "The activity of the 2d SS Panzer Division, located south of St. Lô and constituting the entire Seventh Army reserve, exemplified German flexibility. The division had on 5 July dispatched a kampfgruppe to la Haye-du-Puits and a battalion of tanks to St. Lô while the main body of troops moved toward Périers. The tank battalion near St. Lô marched onto the Carentan-Périers isthmus on 7 July. Two days later a regiment entered the battle between the Taute and the Vire. The regiment fought there until relieved by Panzer Lehr, and then, together with the kampfgruppe near la Haye-du-Puits, helped the 17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division in defense of Périers.[22]"
