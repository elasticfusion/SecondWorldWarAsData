        "Paragraph_26": "As an example of how depleted his units were, he planned to form four kampfgruppen from remnants of ten divisions--one kampfgruppe consisting of what remained of the 84th, 85th, 89th, and 271st Divisions and comprising 1,200 men and 8 artillery batteries; another kampfgruppe consisting of the 276th, 277th, 326th, and 363d Divisions and totaling 1,300 men and 8 batteries; a third of the 3d Parachute Division, 1,500 men and 8 batteries; and a fourth of the 353d Division, 2,000 men and 6 batteries.",
        "Paragraph_27": "He also needed immediate matériel replacements: at least 270 tanks or assault guns to provide each armored division with about 30; 9 artillery battalions of 108-mm. howitzers to replace guns lost by the panzer divisions; and as many 180-mm. howitzers as possible.",
        "Paragraph_28": "He required a 9,000-ton capacity transportation facility to expedite the delivery of essential supplies and the movement of reserve units to the front.",
        "Paragraph_29": "And, finally, he requested that 6 panzer brigades in the process of activation in Germany be dispatched to the Western Front."
