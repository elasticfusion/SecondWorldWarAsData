      "Sub-event": "Completion of OVERLORD and Shift to Continental Base Preparation",
      "Sub-event_summary": "By late August 1944, Operation OVERLORD was virtually complete with a secured continental lodgment area. The next phase involved transforming this lodgment into a robust continental base to support the decisive assault against Germany. Initial plans anticipated halting at the Seine for several weeks, but rapid German withdrawal necessitated immediate pursuit to deny enemy recovery and defensive stands.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_1": "Near the end of August the Allies could consider Operation OVERLORD virtually complete. They had secured a continental lodgment area from which to mount an assault against the heart of Germany. The next step, according to plans, was to transform the lodgment into a continental base to support the blow that was to lay the enemy prostrate and allow Allied troops to overrun the German homeland.",
        "Paragraph_2": "To prepare for the final attack toward Germany, the Allies had intended, even as late as mid-August, to halt for several weeks at the Seine. But developments on the battle front during the second half of August--the partial destruction of two German armies in Normandy and the landings in southern France--had prompted German withdrawal along the entire front. This made it imperative for the Allies to deny the enemy the chance to recover and make a stand at any of several terrain features along the path of retreat that were favorable for defense. Logistical considerations notwithstanding, pursuit operations had to be undertaken at once."

      "Sub-event": "Logistical Situation and Port Development Priorities (Late August)",
      "Sub-event_summary": "Logistical situation unsatisfactory: only Cherbourg operational, minor ports (Isigny, Granville, Cancale) handling limited tonnage. Breton ports (St. Malo destroyed, Brest/Lorient/St. Nazaire held by Germans) remained vital despite increasing distance from front. Autumn weather threatened beach operations. Communications Zone assumed direct delivery responsibilities instead of depot expansion, resulting in insecure base for post-OVERLORD operations.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_3": "When the Allies reached the Seine, the logistical situation was far from satisfactory. With the exception of Cherbourg, the Allies had no major ports. Preinvasion planners had assumed that the conclusion of OVERLORD would find the Americans in possession of the Breton ports of St. Malo, Brest, Quiberon Bay, and Nantes, and the British in position to take Rouen and Le Havre. Although by mid-August the British could anticipate quick capture of the Seine ports and even the Channel ports, the Americans possessed only Cherbourg and the destroyed and useless harbor facilities at St. Malo. Strong German garrisons still held Brest, Lorient (and the Quiberon peninsula), and St. Nazarie (which barred the mouth of the Loire River and therefore access to Nantes). All Allied supplies were still coming across the beaches, with the exception of inconsequential quantities arriving through such minor ports as Isigny, Granville, and Cancale, and somewhat larger amounts discharged at Cherbourg. Although the tonnage landed with such limited facilities exceeded all expectations, the approach of autumn weather cast a shadow on future prospects.",
        "Paragraph_4": "The logistical apparatus on the Continent was also deficient. The spectacular nature of the breakout from the cramped pre-COBRA beachhead had made it impossible for supply installations to keep up with the combat units, supply distances having suddenly changed from tens of miles to hundreds. The First Army had relinquished logistical responsibilities to the Communications Zone at the end of July, just when the demands of the static battle of the hedgerows were giving way to the different requirements of mobile warfare. The Communications Zone, instead of expanding the depot system as planned, had to assume the more pressing task of delivering supplies directly to the consumers. The result was not the most secure logistical base from which to launch post-OVERLORD operations."

      "Sub-event": "Eisenhower's Pursuit Directive and Emphasis on Ports (17–25 August)",
      "Sub-event_summary": "Eisenhower decided 17 August to dash across Seine; confirmed 19 August for strong crossing. On 20 August, with 79th Division securing first Seine bridgehead, focus shifted to Rhine (over 250 miles east). Pursuit imperative to exploit German defeat. Breton ports remained second only to enemy destruction for receiving promised U.S. divisions. VIII Corps tasked with Brest siege coinciding 25 August with Seine pursuit start; Bordeaux targeted next.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_5": "Despite his awareness of the logistical flaws, General Eisenhower on 17 August felt that \"the beating\" the Allies were administering the enemy in Normandy would enable the Allies to \"dash across the Seine.\" Two days later he decided to cross the Seine in strength. On 20 August, while the 79th Division was securing the first Allied bridgehead over the Seine, the Allied command was giving serious consideration to the next goal--the Rhine River, more than two hundred and fifty miles to the east.",
        "Paragraph_6": "The decision to cross the Seine necessitated little soul searching. The example of McClellan at Antietam was too well known. Pursuit of a defeated enemy was axiomatic.",
        "Paragraph_7": "General Eisenhower's decision to pursue the enemy across the Seine changed neither the port development plans nor the prevalent feeling that the Breton ports were vital for the development of the campaign. According to the Allied troop dispositions and the plans for post-OVERLORD operations, the 21 Army Group would advance up the Channel coast while the 12th Army Group drove eastward away from the coast and across northern France. By liberating and opening the Seine and Channel ports, which had been reserved in the OVERLORD planning for British and Canadian logistical operations, the 21 Army Group would ease its supply problems. In contrast, the American forces would be moving away from the coast and lengthening their supply lines. Since in August Cherbourg was still handling less cargo than anticipated and since the gales of September might disrupt and even terminate the beach operations on the invasion coast, sheltered waters and port unloading facilities in Brittany, despite their increasing distance from the front, remained objectives of vital importance.",
        "Paragraph_8": "\"We are promised greatly accelerated shipments of American divisions directly from the United States,\" General Eisenhower explained to General Montgomery as he set forth his thoughts on pursuit operations beyond the Seine, \"and it is mandatory that we capture and prepare ports and communications to receive them. This has an importance second only to the destruction of the remaining enemy forces on our front.\" The speed of Bradley's advance east of Paris, General Eisenhower felt, would be governed by the speed with which the Breton ports could be secured and the supply situation improved.",
        "Paragraph_9": "The opening attack on the most important of the Breton ports, Brest, coincided on 25 August with the start of the pursuit beyond the Seine. Generals Eisenhower, Bradley, and Patton anticipated quick success on both fronts, and the Supreme Commander talked of sending the VIII Corps to secure Bordeaux very soon--as soon as the Breton ports fell.",
        "Paragraph_10": "A fortress city of 80,000 people situated on the northern shore of an excellent landlocked roadstead of ninety square miles, Brest had been a major base of the French Navy. Because it was primarily a naval base and remote from the industrial centers of France, Brest had never attained commercial importance. In World War I, the American Expeditionary Force had used it as the principal port for the direct movement of troops from the United States to France. Though the cargo-handling facilities were not as good as at other French ports, Brest offered the Allies an excellent deep water harbor. The railroad from Brest to Rennes, along the north shore of Brittany, had been captured in good condition, and supplies discharged at Brest could easily be transported to the troops in the interior of France.",
        "Paragraph_11": "Conscious of the deficiency of unloading equipment at Brest and of the probability that the Germans would destroy all facilities before letting the port fall into Allied hands, the Allies had drawn plans for constructing a port complex at Quiberon Bay. Yet in order to use not only Quiberon but also Lorient, St. Nazaire, and Nantes, the Allies first had to clear the sea lanes around the Brittany tip--that is, eliminate the German naval base at Brest and seize the submarine pens there.",
        "Paragraph_12": "In the same way that the Allies thought the fall of St. Malo would weaken the German will to resist at the other port cities, they hoped that the reduction of Brest would affect the morale of the garrisons at Lorient and St. Nazaire. After Brest, the Allies intended to attack Lorient \"if it was still holding out.\"",
        "Paragraph_13": "Thus it came about that as the Allies plunged into pursuit of the retreating enemy east of the Seine, more than fifty thousand U.S. troops became involved in siege operations against the fortress of Brest, three hundred miles west of the front."
