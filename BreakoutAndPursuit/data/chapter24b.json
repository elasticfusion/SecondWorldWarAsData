        "Paragraph_1": "The first echelon of the attacking force was to be composed of three armored divisions moving westward abreast toward an initial objective along the Brécey-St. Hilaire road. The *116th Panzer Division* on the right was to attack without prior assembly and strike along the north bank of the Sée River toward Chérencé; it was to be echeloned to the right rear to protect the north flank. Making the main effort in the center, the *2d Panzer Division* (reinforced by a panzer battalion each from the *1st SS* and the *116th Panzer Divisions)* was to thrust along the south bank of the Sée, using the St. Barthélemy-Reffuveille road as its principal axis of advance. The *2d SS Panzer Division* (reinforced by the *17th SS Panzer Grenadiers,* a division reduced by combat to regimental strength) was to attack on both sides of Mortain; it was to be echeloned to the left to cover the open south flank. Following the first echelon closely, the *1st SS Panzer Division* (less an armored infantry regiment and a tank battalion, which remained with the *Fifth Panzer Army)* was to exploit initial success and capture Avranches. The reconnaissance battalion of *Panzer Lehr* was to patrol the deep south flank. The *LXXXI Corps* was to block a possible American thrust toward Alençon."

With regard to weather, a vital factor, forecasters had predicted fog for the following morning, a desirable condition for the attack. If the fog cleared later in the day, the Luftwaffe was prepared to furnish aerial support in strength. The commander of the fighter plane contingent in the west had visited the *Seventh Army* command post on 6 August to inform the ground troops that three hundred operational planes in France had been gathered to provide cover for the counterattack the next day. The ground opposition seemed weak, for only elements of two U.S. divisions, the 3d Armored and the 30th Infantry, had been identified in the attack zone, as was the actual case. Against them were concentrated between 120 and 190 German tanks poised for the surprise attack. Once Avranches was captured, a newly arriving infantry division, the *331st* (scheduled to be at Tinchebray by 9 August), would be committed between the *XLVII Panzer Corps* and the *LXXXIV Corps* in order to regain Brécey.<sup>[10](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn10)</sup>"

Units had assembled while in almost constant contact with Allied forces. In some instances, they had been compelled to fight their way to assembly points while in danger of being encircled. There was no distinct boundary between moving into position and jumping off in attack. Many units had already taken heavy losses before the attack started. In contrast with the usual daily personnel losses that averaged about 3 percent of those units in contact, German casualty reports for 6 August inexplicably attained heights of 30 and 40 percent. The meaning of the casualty figures was obscure to the Germans, for although it indicated the urgent necessity of getting the counterattack under way before attrition sapped the strength of their forces in Normandy, the fact that the *353d Division* (kampfgruppe size) and *363d Division* had together knocked out 28 American tanks on 6 August indicated that the German units, though severely reduced, were still combat effective.<sup>[11](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn11)</sup>"

      "Sub-event_summary": "At 2200 on 6 August, Funck requested postponement due to delays in 1st SS Panzer Division arrival and Schwerin's failure to provide reinforcements; Hausser delayed to midnight but proceeded.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_4": "At H Hour--2200, 6 August--Hausser received a phone call from Funck, the *XLVII Panzer Corps* commander, who wanted the attack postponed. Two factors, Funck felt, made this necessary. First, the advance elements of the *1st SS Panzer Division* (the exploiting force) were only beginning to reach Tinchebray, even though the division commander had promised to be ready to cross the line of departure in strength a good six miles farther west around 2300. Obviously, the division would not be able to reach its assigned position in time. Nor would it be able to detach an armored battalion in time to reinforce the *2d Panzer Division* as planned. The reasons for the delay in arrival were several: the *89th Division* had been slow in relieving the *1st SS* on the *Fifth Panzer Army* front; traffic congestion and Allied air attacks had harassed the approach march; and finally, a piece of pure bad luck, the panzer battalion hurrying toward the *2d Panzer Division* had been moving through a defile in close formation when a crashing Allied fighter-bomber fell on the lead tank, blocked the entire battalion, and forced the tanks to back up and turn around in constricted space.",
        "Paragraph_5": "The second factor that Funck brought to Hausser's attention was the attitude of the commander of the *116th Panzer Division,* Generalleutnant Gerhard Graf von Schwerin, who had not dispatched the tank battalion he was supposed to furnish the *2d Panzer Division.* This was not the first time, Funck explained, that the commander of the *116th* had failed to comply with orders. He requested that Schwerin be relieved.",
        "Paragraph_6": "Hausser was inclined to agree with Funck that the news of both incidents was serious, but he was unwilling to postpone the attack. Hausser's only concession was to delay the jump-off until midnight to give the *1st SS Panzer Division* two more hours to come forward. He did nothing about Schwerin.<sup>[12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn12)</sup>"

There was no significant American opposition, and by noon of 7 August *2d SS Panzer* troops held blocking positions about half way between Mortain and St. Hilaire, thereby protecting the southern flank of the attack of the *2d SS Panzer* zone south and west of Mortain. A thrust to St. Hilaire and a direct threat to Avranches from the southeast seemed simple except for the 2d Battalion, 120th Infantry, ensconced and encircled on Hill 317 immediately east of Mortain. This contingent, with unexcelled observation of the *2d SS Panzer* zone south and west of Mortain, called for artillery fire on the division and thus pinned the troops down, preventing further advance.<sup>[13](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn13)</sup>"

There, some elements turned north to protect the flank against a possible thrust from Chérencé, while the main body continued west toward the Brécey-St. Hilaire road. Shortly after daybreak, 7 August, just west of le Mesnil-Adelée and three miles short of the initial objective, the column encountered resistance that forced a halt.",

With tank losses skyrocketing, Funck halted the attack around noon and instructed the troops to dig in.",

        "Paragraph_12": "The north flank along the Sée was open, and it gave the German command particular cause for concern because the *116th Panzer Division* had failed to attack. Schwerin had been threatened with encirclement by American attacks toward Gathemo and Chérencé, and he had simply withheld the attack order from his subordinates. He had no confidence in the ability of the *84th Division,* which was relieving him, to hold against the American pressure, and consequently felt that he could neither detach a tank battalion to the *2d Panzer Division* nor launch the attack toward Avranches. Also, Schwerin had apparently lost hope for victory. Involved in the conspiracy of July 20th, he was one of the field commanders who were to have negotiated with the Allies for an armistice. No matter whether tactical or political factors were more important to Schwerin, his failure to participate in the Avranches counterattack was a flagrant case of disobedience. At 1600, 7 August, Hausser and Funck relieved him of command and replaced him with Funck's chief of staff, Col. Walter Rein-hard. Thirty minutes later the division finally jumped off. The troops made no progress.<sup>[15](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn15)</sup>"

The attack had achieved surprise, and the armored troops had rolled forward about six miles. When the day dawned clear, without the anticipated fog, the ground troops, who were experienced in Normandy and knew what to expect from Allied air superiority, began to dig in. At that moment the advance came to a halt, and the commitment of the *1st SS Panzer Division* availed nothing. Heavy American artillery fires indicated that surprise was already gone. When Allied planes came out in force to bomb and strafe the armored columns, the troops were already under cover, their vehicles under camouflage, but British Hurricanes and Typhoons firing rockets nevertheless struck awe into the German formations. As for the mighty German air effort promised, the fighter planes that got off the ground near Paris did not get much beyond their airfields. Allied squadrons engaged them at once, and not a single German plane reached Mortain that day.<sup>[16](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn16)</sup>"

If Kluge had waited until the *9th SS, 10th SS,* and *9th Panzer Divisions* had been assembled for a truly massive effort, Hitler felt, the attack more than likely would have brought better results.

        "Paragraph_19": "Hausser, too, admitted failure on 7 August. He ascribed the causes to the Allied air superiority, the immobility of the *116th Panzer Division,* and a stronger than expected American resistance. Although additional striking forces augmented the chances of regaining Avranches, continuing threats to the army's flanks increased the chances of disaster. But since Hitler felt that the outcome of the war depended on another attack toward Avranches, there was no choice.<sup>[20](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn20)</sup>"
