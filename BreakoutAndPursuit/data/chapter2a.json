      "Sub-event_summary": "Germany faced active military operations on four fronts: the Soviet advance in the east, partisan activity in the Balkans, Allied operations in Italy, and the Allied offensive in western France. Only Scandinavia remained relatively static. The Eastern Front commanded the majority of German resources, though the Normandy invasion represented a direct threat to the homeland. From July onward, the Eastern and Western Fronts received roughly equal strategic attention despite unequal resource allocation.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_1": "At the beginning of July 1944, Germany was the target of military operations on four fronts: the Soviet drive in the east, the partisan warfare in the Balkans, the Allied operations in Italy, and the Allied offensive in western France. Only in Scandinavia did German military forces enjoy the quiet of a relatively static situation.",
        "Paragraph_2": "Of the four fronts, the Balkan battlefield was of minor importance, and the Italian sector, where the Germans fought a delaying action as they fell back, was of secondary significance. The Eastern Front, engaging the preponderance of German resources, was of most concern to the Germans, although the cross-Channel attack had posed a more direct threat to the homeland, and for a brief time--until the Russians launched their summer offensive late in June--the Normandy front was more important. From July on, the Eastern and Western Fronts received nearly equal attention from those directing the German war effort, though far from equal resources."

In addition to the responsibility and the nominal command borne by all heads of states, Hitler exercised a direct control over military operations. He determined the military strategy on all fronts and supervised closely the formulation of plans and their execution. Increasingly, as the struggle continued, he controlled the tactical operations of the troops. This close control of the military was perhaps inevitable. The pyramidal hierarchy of command reached its ultimate in him.",
        "Paragraph_4": "With an active and bold imagination, and often displaying an astute grasp of military matters, Hitler could coordinate his military objectives and his political goals far better than anyone else in Germany. Though by 1944 Hitler had delegated to others many of his governmental functions, he felt that he could not afford to do so in the military realm. The urgency of the life and death struggle with the Allies, he was convinced, compelled him to give his personal attention even to relatively minor problems, and his self-assumed commitments overworked him."

France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, though under the nominal control of OB WEST, each had a military governor who exercised responsibility for internal security of the occupied territory; yet for tactical action against an invading enemy, OB WEST had operational control over the troops assigned to the military governors. OKW maintained direct contact with each military governor and supervised OB WEST supply and administration.",
        "Paragraph_6": "For tactical operations OB WEST controlled two army groups. These had the mission of defending the Channel and Atlantic and the Mediterranean coast lines of the OB WEST area. Their zones of operations were the Netherlands and Belgium and those French administrative and political departments touching the sea. The boundary between the army groups was an east--west line across France from the Loire River to the Swiss border near Lake Geneva, although there was always a lack of clarity as to whether OB WEST or the military governor exercised authority over tactical troops in central France. (Map 2)",
        "Paragraph_7": "South of the boundary was the sector of Army Group G, a headquarters that controlled the First Army, which defended the Atlantic coast of France south of the Loire, and Nineteenth Army, which held the Mediterranean shores of France. The Replacement Army, which trained units in the interior of France, furnished troops for security duties against the FFI and was ready to undertake operations against airborne landings.",
        "Paragraph_8": "North of the Loire-Geneva boundary line was Army Group B. Under this headquarters, LXXXVIII Corps occupied the Netherlands, Fifteenth Army defended the coast of Belgium and of northern France to the Seine River, and Seventh Army had responsibility for that part of northwest France between the Seine and the Loire Rivers.",
        "Paragraph_9": "The chain of command, then, that had functioned to meet the Allied invasion of western Europe consisted of Hitler; the OKW, which transmitted Hitler's orders; OB WEST, the ground force headquarters in the west that operated as the theater command; Army Group B, which had tactical control of the troops along the Channel coast; and Seventh Army, which had found itself responsible for the area invaded."
