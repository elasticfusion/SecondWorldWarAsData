Source_Link: $SourceLink
Source_Link_Capture_Date:With the following specifications:

Specifications:
	- Prefer Grokipedia sources over Wikipedia
	- Use Wikipedia Sources whe Grokipedia has no entries.
	- Create as many unique entries as there are events and sub-events
	- [ISO 3166 Alpha-2] = ISO 3166 Alpha-2 code
	- When incorporating links to non-'https://www.ibiblio.org/' sites include current date/time of the inclusion.
TOE:
	- Unit(s) 
	- Unit_Nationality
	- Commander_Name
	- Commander_Rank
	- TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Status = Relieved, WIA or KIA:
		  -If the the commander status did not change during the event, ignore the field
		  - TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Date = last day of command
		  - List multiple commanders, if a commander is relieved, wounded or killed.
		  - Attempt to ascertain what the the unit be being discussed is attached to.  For example, a battalion might be attached to a division.  A division to a Corp.
		  - A feature of European Theater is that sub-units might be shifted around.  So they are date sensitive.
		  - Include the commander of higher unit if it can be determined.
		Biographical_reference:
			- Add a link to https://grokipedia.com/ if it exists
		  	- If not add a link to Wikipedia if it exists
	- Equipment Example:
		Name:
			- Sherman
		Identifier:
		- M4
	- Personnel: Was the unit fully staffed?
	- Supply:
		- Were there supply shortages?
Events:
	- Evaluate every paragraph, group paragraphs together as an event.
	- 'Event' is a mandatory field
	- A sub-event is classified as an event that occurs at roughly the same Place/Date and should be treated a unique entry with the same event.
	- Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn] (for example, it should document the absolute paragraph for all paragraphs in the entire $SourceLink and include all text used in analysis.
	- The goal of paragraph number is to be able to easily find the paragraph in the original document.
	- Awards such as Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and Medal of Honor (MoH) should be treated as sub-events:
		- For all awards, attempt to retrieve the original citation
	- Unique Locations are sub-events
	- Unique military units mentioned are to be classified as sub-events
	- A summary of the the sub event should be included.
Place:
	- The GPS coordinates should be are close to the location as possible
	- Map_reference, is applicable when the text indicate a Map image
	Maplink:
		- See: https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/:
		- Roman Numeral identified Maps are at the section:  "Maps I-XLIII are in Inverse Order Inside Back Cover"
		- Maps with regular numbers are at the section:  "MAPS"
	ExternalMapLink: Search for maps directly related to the event/sub-event.
Weather:
	- Every Place name should have a corresponding Weather record
	- Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates example:
		- West: -180.0
		- East: 180.0
		- South: -90.0
		- North: 90.0
	- A Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates should be created using the Place.Place_GPS_coordinate as the center point and going outwards 100 kilometers.
Time and Date:
	- The "Date_group_of_event" is always as published in the text.
	- For date keep a consistent format:
		- DDHHMMZmmmYY, using the Date-time group as specified in: https://web.archive.org/web/20170321080040/http://www.gwg.nga.mil/ntb/baseline/docs/2500a/2500a.pdf
	Assumptions about Dates and Times:
		- All date times in the text are British Double Summer Time (BDST) until 15 Jul 1944
		- From 15 Jul 1944 and forward, assume British Summer Time (BST)
		- 'Zulu_date_group_of_event' is a conversion from BDST and BST to Universal Time
	For imprecise dates and times use:
		- For imprecise dates use: "BEGINNING mmmYY" or "END mmmYY"
		- Imprecise times, use  "APPROX 240900Z mmmYY"
	For "Source_of_date_group_of_event":
		- Default to use of "Source Link: $SourceLink if it exists.
		- Use Grok to search the web for Date.Date_group_of_event if the value is empty.
		- Populate Date.Source_date_group_of_event with the source link that Grok found.
Casualties Specification:
	- KIA = Killed in Action
	- WIA = Wounded in Action
	- PoW = Prisoner of War
	- MIA = Missing in Action
	- If Casualties are unknown, set the value to '0'
Media:

	- Time of media creation should be concurrent to the event
	- If there is a license associated with media, it should be noted
SourceLink: $SourceLink
Footnotes:
	- $Footnotelink
	- If an event has a footnote, follow that that link and place it into Footnote "Source:" field
	- If the footnote has a link, note the link
	- If a footnote lists multiple documents, each document should be in it's own individual JSON structure.  For example, footnote 1 references two works, the first would be 1a and the second would be 1b.
	- If a footnote source lists a document, attempt to find that document online.   Only include the document is if it quoted in it's entirety or has substantial excerpts.
	- Attach footnotes to the appropriate sub-event and incorporate into the sub-event JSON stanza.
	- Award recipients, should always have an individual footnote.
	- Note that documents attributed to '"NonDigital_Library_Source": "OCMH"' have often been moved to either the National Archive or The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center (USAHEC)
	For non-Digital documents:
		- Find the library
		- The address of the of the library
		- NonDigital_Library_References is the information required to ask the library to retrieve the information
