> ### *Sweeping the North Shore*
>
> Slipping out of the St. Malo area during darkness, Task Force A bypassed Dinan on the south and moved westward on 6 August toward St. Brieuc, thirty miles from Dinan.<sup>[11](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn21.html#fn11)</sup> Contact was made that afternoon with FFI groups commanded by Colonel Eon, who was already in possession of St. Brieuc. Task Force A found the three bridges near the town intact, and General Earnest detailed an engineer company to guard

> them and to operate a prisoner of war enclosure.<sup>[12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn21.html#fn12)</sup>
>
> At Châtelaudren, ten miles west of St. Brieuc, Task Force A quickly overran about a company of Germans on the morning of 7 August and, accompanied by men of the French Resistance, continued five miles beyond toward Guingamp. Mine fields and antitank obstacles outside Guingamp prompted a halt. Part of the cavalry and some FFI had meanwhile made a wide detour to envelop Guingamp from the south and after infiltrating the town reported that some Germans remained but that the greater part of the garrison had withdrawn to the west. These reports and the fact that the main body of the task force had received no fire from the positions east of Guingamp encouraged General Earnest to attack despite the late hour. Against light resistance the task force took the town.<sup>[13](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn21.html#fn13)</sup>
>
> The most important bridge on the double-track railway was at Morlaix, thirty miles west of Guingamp. It was an arched stone structure some thousand feet in length and two hundred feet in height, the largest railroad viaduct in France.<sup>[14](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn21.html#fn14)</sup> Suspecting that strong German forces would be in Morlaix, General Earnest endeavored to make contact with the 6th Armored Division so that he might call for help if necessary. "Where is Six Armored Division right flank?" he radioed Middleton. Middleton's reply of necessity was rather vague.<sup>[15](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn21.html#fn15)</sup> As the task force approached Morlaix, Earnest tried without success to reach the armored division by radio.
>
> German troops of the *266th Division* had indeed occupied Morlaix, but early on 8 August the Germans departed the town to seek refuge in Brest. Driving toward Morlaix that same morning, Task Force A encountered only about a hundred Germans deployed around a château just east of the town. Taking the strongpoint by surprise, the Americans entered Morlaix and found the railroad viaduct intact.<sup>[16](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn21.html#fn16)</sup>
>
> On the following morning, 9 August, the task force took a bridge south of Morlaix, and General Earnest reported that he had completed his mission. FFI detachments guarding the main highways between Dinan and Landivisiau had extended their control over the smaller roads. Task Force A captured more than 1,200 Germans; FFI, about 300. American and French losses were small.<sup>[17](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn21.html#fn17)</sup>
>
> Earnest was preparing to join the 6th Armored Division at Brest when Middleton radioed him a new mission. The task force was to return to Morlaix and proceed from there northeast to the coast to secure the beaches of the bay of St. Michel-en-Grève, where cargo arriving

> from England was to be unloaded.<sup>[18](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn21.html#fn18)</sup> German strongpoints had earlier commanded the beach, but only mines and angle-iron obstacles remained. Earnest's troops met no opposition as they extended their control over St. Michel-en-Grève on 11 August. Three LST's hove into sight that day and prepared to unload supplies. To insure security for supply operations, the task force patrolled the coastal region, cleared disorganized German troops from the area, and took more than a thousand prisoners; losses totaled 25.<sup>[19](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn21.html#fn19)</sup>
>
> Middleton considered recalling Task Force A to St. Malo, but the FFI commander, Eon, persuaded him otherwise. A German garrison near Paimpol still held coastal forts overlooking the western approaches to the bay of St. Brieuc, thereby denying the Allies use of the St. Brieuc port and allowing the Germans to furnish the Channel Island troops with foodstuffs procured on the mainland. Eon proposed to clear the Paimpol area and requested a display of American force during his attack. Middleton gave Eon a thousand gallons of gasoline to transport about 2,500 FFI troops and instructed Earnest to send along a few armored cars, some tank destroyers, and perhaps a battery of artillery. Expecting the FFI to carry the brunt of the combat, Middleton cautioned Earnest against forming a Franco-American force under a single commander. French and Americans were to share the profits of the venture, the Americans to get the prisoners, the FFI the captured arms and equipment.<sup>[20](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn21.html#fn20)</sup>
>
> The extent of the German opposition soon drew Task Force A into what developed into a four-day engagement. After reducing a strongpoint near Lezardrieux (three miles west of Paimpol) and taking 430 prisoners, the Americans and the French launched an attack against Paimpol, cleared the town by noon, 17 August, and captured more than 2,000 prisoners and much equipment. At the same time, a reinforced battalion of the 8th Division in an independent action on 15 August cleared the Cap Frehel area, midway between Dinan and St. Brieuc, by firing a few white phosphorus rounds of 4.2-inch mortar and rounding up 300 prisoners.
>
> The north shore had been swept clear, an achievement that belonged largely to Task Force A. The task force had secured a useable communications net between Dinan and Landivisiau. Although the railroad was of little worth because the port of Brest was not in American hands, the Task Force A operation was significant in a later context. To a large extent it made possible the logistical support for the major effort subsequently to be exerted to capture Brest.
