> ### *The Defenses*
> 
> The Germans had no intention of falling back. From the high ground near la Haye-du-Puits, so dominating that observers on the crests could watch Allied shipping off the invasion beaches, Germans studied the preparations for the attack they had been expecting for almost two weeks. They were ready. Yet despite their readiness, they were almost taken by surprise. The state of affairs harked back to the development of the *LXXXIV Corps* defenses west of the Prairies Marécageuses de Gorges.
> 
> In June, just before American troops had cut the Cherbourg peninsula and isolated the port, Rundstedt, Rommel, Dollman, and Fahrmbacher had decided to divide the *LXXXIV Corps* forces into two groups--one in the north to defend Cherbourg, the other to block American movement south. Their intention had been to leave weak forces in defense of Cherbourg and to build a strong line across the Cotentin from Portbail to the Prairies Marécageuses de Gorges.<sup>[11](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn4.html#fn11")</sup> By insisting on compliance with original plans for a forceful defense of Cherbourg, however, Hitler had disrupted the German commanders' plan. As a result, the troops in the south were weaker than had been hoped. The designated chief of the forces in the south (Generalleutnant Heinz Hellmich of the *243d Division*) was killed in action on 17 June, and Col. Eugen Koenig (the acting commander of the *91st Infantry Division*, whose general had died on 6 June) became the local commander responsible for erecting a defense to halt the expected drive to the south.
> 
> Koenig had had available a total of about 3,500 combat effective soldiers of several units: remnants of the *91st* and *243d Divisions*, a kampfgruppe of the *265th Division* (from Brittany), and miscellaneous elements including *Osttruppen*, non-German volunteers from eastern Europe. Together, the troops composed about half the effective combat strength of a fresh infantry division. With these few forces, but with adequate artillery in support, Koenig had fashioned a line that utilized marshland as a defensive barrier.
> 
> When Choltitz had taken command of the *LXXXIV Corps*, he had soon come to the conclusion that he could not depend on Koenig to hold for long. American paratroopers of the 82d Airborne Division had actually penetrated the marsh line as early as 12 June.<sup>[12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn4.html#fn12")</sup> Koenig's forces were too weak to

> eliminate the penetration or to hold the positions already seriously threatened. The *Osttruppen* were not always reliable.<sup>[13](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn4.html#fn13")</sup> Besides, Choltitz felt that the high ground near la Haye-du-Puits was better defensive terrain. He therefore had his reserve units--the *353d Division*, which had just arrived from Brittany, and remnants of the *77th Division* establish positions on the Montgardon ridge and on Mont Castre. The ridge defenses, sometimes called the Mahlmann Line after the commander of the *353d*, were hastily organized because of anxiety that the Americans might attack at any moment. When the positions were established, Choltitz regarded them as his main line of resistance. Thinking of Koenig's troops as manning an outpost line, he expected them to resist as long as possible and eventually to fall back to the ridge line.
> 
> In contrast with Choltitz's idea, Rundstedt had recommended that the main line of resistance be established even farther back--at the water line formed by the Ay and Sèves Rivers. Although Choltitz did not place troops there, he considered the water line a convenient rally point in case withdrawal from the la Haye-du-Puits positions became necessary.<sup>[14](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn4.html#fn14")</sup> Hitler, who disapproved of all defensive lines behind the front because he feared they invited withdrawal, wanted Koenig's positions to be held firmly. To inculcate the idea of holding fast, he had Koenig's defenses designated the main line of resistance. With Koenig's marsh line marked on maps as the main defenses in the area, the fresh troops of the *353d Division* seemed unoccupied. In order to use them, OKW ordered Hausser to have Choltitz move the *353d* to replace the panzer grenadiers in the eastern portion of the corps sector. The panzer grenadiers were to disengage and become a mobile reserve for the *Seventh Army*. With the *353d* scheduled to depart the high ground around la Haye-du-Puits, Choltitz had to reduce the Mahlmann Line to the reality of a rally line manned entirely by the kampfgruppe of the *77th*.
> 
> By 3 July the *77th Division* troops had moved to the eastern part of Mont Castre, while the *353d* was moving from ridge positions to assembly near Périers. The VIII Corps attack thus occurred at a time of flux. Members of the *LXXXIV Corps* staff had correctly assumed, from the noise of tank motors they heard during the night of 2 July, that an American attack was in the making, and they had laid interdictory fires on probable assembly areas. But judging that the rain would delay the jump-off--on the basis that bad weather neutralized American air power--the *Seventh Army* staff mistakenly labeled the VIII Corps offensive only a reconnaissance in force with tank support. The real American intention soon became apparent to both headquarters, however, and Hausser and Choltitz recalled the *353d Division* from Périers and repositioned the men on the high ground about la Haye-du-Puits.<sup>[15](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn4.html#fn15")</sup> Hitler's desires notwithstanding, these positions became the main line of resistance.

> As a result of the last-minute changes that occurred on 3 July, the Germans opposing VIII Corps were able to defend from positions in depth. Fanned out in front was *Group Koenig*, with parts of the *91st*, the *265th*, and the *243d Divisions* on the flanks, and east European volunteers (including a large contingent of Russians) generally holding the center. Artillery support was more than adequate--the entire division artillery of the *243d*, plus two cannon companies, five antitank companies, a complete tank destroyer battalion, and an assortment of miscellaneous howitzers, rocket launchers, antiaircraft batteries, captured Russian guns, and several old French light tanks. Behind *Group Koenig*, the *353d* and a kampfgruppe of the *353d* were to defend the high ground of the Montgardon ridge and Mont Castre. The *2d SS Panzer Division*, assembling well south of St. Lô in *Seventh Army* reserve, was able to move, if needed, to meet a serious threat near la Haye-du-Puits.<sup>[16](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn4.html#fn16")</sup> Even closer, in the center of the *LXXXIV Corps* sector, south of Périers, was one regiment (the *15th*) of the *5th Parachute Division* (still in Brittany). Although under OKW control, it could probably be used in an emergency to augment the la Haye-du-Puits defenses. All together, the German forces were far from being a pushover.
