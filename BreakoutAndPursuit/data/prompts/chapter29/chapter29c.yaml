> ### *French Aims*
>
> Though was not an immediate major military goal to the Allies, to Frenchmen it meant the liberation of France. More than the spiritual capital, Paris was the only place from which the country could be effectively governed. It was the hub of national administration and politics and the center of the railway system, the communication lines, and the highways. Control of the city was particularly important in August 1944, because Paris was the prize of an intramural contest for power within the French Resistance movement.
>
> The fundamental aim of the Resistance--to rid France of the Germans-cemented together men of conflicting philosophies and interests but did not entirely hide the cleavage between the patriots within occupied France and those outside the country--groups in mutual contact only by secret radios and underground messengers.<sup>[16](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn16)</sup> Outside France the Resistance had developed a politically homogeneous character under de Gaulle, who had established a political headquarters in Algiers and a military staff in London, and had proclaimed just before the cross-Channel attack that he headed a provisional government. Inside France, although it was freely acknowledged that de Gaulle had symbolically inspired anti-German resistance, heterogeneous groups had formed spontaneously into small, autonomous organizations existing in a precarious and clandestine status.<sup>[17](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn17)</sup> In 1943 political supporters of de Gaulle inside and outside France were instrumental in creating a supreme co-ordinating Resistance agency within the country that, while not eradicating factionalism, had the effect of providing a common direction to Resistance activity and increasing de Gaulle's strength and authority in Allied eyes.
>
> Although political lines were not yet sharply drawn, a large, vociferous, and increasingly influential contingent of the left contested de Gaulle's leadership inside France. This group clamored for arms, ammunition, and military supplies, the more to harass the Germans. Some few in 1943 hoped in this small way to create the second front demanded by the Soviet Union. The de Gaullists outside the country were not anxious to have large amounts of military stores parachuted into France, and the matériel supplied was dropped in rural areas rather than near urban centers, not only to escape German detection but also to inhibit the development of a strong left-wing opposition.<sup>[18](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn18)</sup>

> in establishing the entire Resistance movement as the handmaiden of the Allied liberating armies. The Resistance groups inside France became an adjunct of OVERLORD. French Resistance members, instead of launching independent operations against the Germans, were primarily to furnish information and render assistance to the Allied military forces. To co-ordinate this activity with the Allied operations, a military organization of Resistance members was formed shortly before the cross-Channel attack: the French Forces of the Interior. SHAEF formally recognized the FFI as a regular armed force and accepted the organization as a component of the OVERLORD forces. General Koenig (whose headquarters was in London), the military chief of the Free French armed forces already under SHAEF, became the FFI commander. When the Allies landed on French soil, the FFI (except those units engaged in operations not directly connected with the OVERLORD front--primarily those in the south, which were oriented toward the forthcoming ANVIL landing on the Mediterranean coast) came under the command of SHAEF and thus under de Gaulle's control.<sup>[19](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn19)</sup>
>
> News in July of unrest in Paris and intimations that there was agitation for an unaided liberation of the city by the Resistance led General Koenig to order immediate cessation of activities that might cause social and political convulsion.<sup>[20](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn29.html#fn20)</sup> Since Allied plans did not envision the immediate liberation of the capital, a revolt might provoke bloody suppression on the part of the Germans, a successful insurrection might place de Gaullist opponents in the seat of political power, civil disorder might burgeon into full-scale revolution.
>
> Despite Koenig's order, the decrease in the German garrison in August, the approach of American troops, and the disintegration of the Pétain government promoted an atmosphere charged with patriotic excitement. By 18 August more than half the railway workers were on strike and virtually all the policemen in the capital had disappeared from the streets for the same reason. Public anti-German demonstrations occurred frequently. Armed FFI members moved through the streets quite openly. Resistance posters appeared calling for a general strike, for mobilization, for insurrection.
>
> The German reaction to these manifestations of brewing revolt seemed so feeble that on 19 August small local FFI groups, without central direction or discipline, forcibly took possession of police stations, town halls, national ministries, newspaper buildings, and the seat of the municipal government, the Hôtel de Ville. The military component of the French Resistance, the FFI, thus disobeyed orders and directly challenged Choltitz.

Events:
	- Evaluate every paragraph, group paragraphs together as an event.
	- 'Event' is a mandatory field
	- A sub-event is classified as an event that occurs at roughly the same Place/Date and should be treated a unique entry with the same event.
	- Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn] (for example, it should document the absolute paragraph for all paragraphs in the entire $SourceLink and include all text used in analysis.
		- In the Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn], the brakets are for documentation purposes only and should not be included in the data
	- The goal of paragraph number is to be able to easily find the paragraph in the original document.
	- Never summarize Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn].
	- The goal of '"Footnote_References":' is to relate to to the original footnote.  An original footnote will be exclusively a whole number (1, 2, 3, for example)
	- Awards such as Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and Medal of Honor (MoH) should be treated as sub-events:
		- For all awards, attempt to retrieve the original citation
	- Unique Locations are sub-events
	- Unique military units mentioned are to be classified as sub-events
	- A summary of the the sub event should be included.
Place:
	- The GPS coordinates should be are close to the location as possible
	- Map_reference, is applicable when the text indicate a Map image
	Maplink:
		- See: https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/:
		- Roman Numeral identified Maps are at the section:  "Maps I-XLIII are in Inverse Order Inside Back Cover"
		- Maps with regular numbers are at the section:  "MAPS"
	ExternalMapLink: Search for maps directly related to the event/sub-event.
Weather:
	- Every Place name should have a corresponding Weather record
	- Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates example:
		- West: -180.0
		- East: 180.0
		- South: -90.0
		- North: 90.0
	- A Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates should be created using the Place.Place_GPS_coordinate as the center point and going outwards 100 kilometers.
Time and Date:
	- The "Date_group_of_event" is always as published in the text.
	- For date keep a consistent format:
		- DDHHMMZmmmYY, using the Date-time group as specified in: https://web.archive.org/web/20170321080040/http://www.gwg.nga.mil/ntb/baseline/docs/2500a/2500a.pdf
	Assumptions about Dates and Times:
		- All date times in the text are British Double Summer Time (BDST) until 15 Jul 1944
		- From 15 Jul 1944 and forward, assume British Summer Time (BST)
		- For German sourced events:
			  - Check the footnote source as to whether the source is a german document or a german post-ware interview
			  - Assume GMT+2, Central European Time (CET)
		- 'Zulu_date_group_of_event' is a conversion from BDST, BST and CET to Universal Time
	For imprecise dates and times use:
		- For imprecise dates use: "BEGINNING mmmYY" or "END mmmYY"
		- Imprecise times, use  "APPROX 240900Z mmmYY"
	For "Source_of_date_group_of_event":
		- Default to use of "Source Link: $SourceLink if it exists.
		- Use Grok to search the web for Date.Date_group_of_event if the value is empty.
		- Populate Date.Source_date_group_of_event with the source link that Grok found.

Casualties Specification:
	- KIA = Killed in Action

	- $Footnotelink
	- Be complete, analyze all footnotes
	- If an event has a footnote, follow that that link and place it into Footnote "Source:" field
	- If the footnote has a link, note the link
	- If a footnote lists multiple documents, each document should be in it's own individual JSON structure.  For example, footnote 1 references two works, the first would be 1a and the second would be 1b.
	- "Footnote" references the modified footnote number, 1a, 1b, etc...
		  - "Footnote_Number" reference the original footnote number.
	- If a footnote source lists a document, attempt to find that document online.   Only include the document is if it quoted in it's entirety or has substantial excerpts.
	- Attach footnotes to the appropriate sub-event and incorporate into the sub-event JSON stanza.
	- Award recipients, should always have an individual footnote.
	- Note that documents attributed to '"NonDigital_Library_Source": "OCMH"' have often been moved to either the National Archive or The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center (USAHEC)
