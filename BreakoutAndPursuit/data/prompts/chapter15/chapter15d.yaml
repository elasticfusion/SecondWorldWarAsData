> ### *A Clash of Spearheads*
>
> While the V Corps and the British were driving toward Vire from the north and northeast, XIX Corps was thrusting toward Vire from the northwest. The evidence unearthed by COBRA indicated that the Germans had nothing to stop a XIX Corps advance along the west bank of the Vire, and General Bradley had acted on that premise. Unfortunately, Kluge had not been idle.
>
> As early as the evening of 27 July, Kluge had begun to try to plug the spreading gap between *LXXXIV* and *II Parachute Corps.* He seized upon the *2d Panzer Division,* then under *Panzer Group West* control. The panzer division had been relieved from frontline duty on 22 July by the *326th Infantry Division* (which had come from the Pas-de-Calais), and the armored unit had moved into reserve southwest of Caen. Having had a few days of respite from battle, the *2d Panzer Division* was to move westward and across the Vire River to launch a counterattack designed to close the gap.
>
> Kluge at first thought of using the *II Parachute Corps* to direct the counterattack, but he quickly decided to insert a new corps between the II *Parachute* and the *LXXXIV.* The *LVIII Panzer Corps* headquarters was moving from the *Fifteenth Army* toward the *Panzer Group West* area, and Kluge considered employing the panzer corps in the *Seventh Army* center to handle the *2d Panzer Division* counterthrust already planned to take place toward Marigny and St. Gilles.<sup>[46](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn46)</sup> Kluge soon recognized, however, that the situation was changing too rapidly for him to await commitment of the *LVIII Panzer Corps.* Taking the *XLVII Panzer Corps,* which was not only more experienced but also closer to the Cotentin, and replacing it in the *Panzer Group West* front with the incoming *LVIII,* Kluge ordered the *XLVII* to take control of the *2d Panzer Division.* By then the division was moving to an assembly area directly behind the *352d Division* on the west bank of the Vire.<sup>[47](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn47)</sup>
>
> Though Kluge was obviously concerned by the gap in the middle of the *Seventh Army,* he judged the *Panzer Group West* front still to be the more critical sector. The 2d Canadian Corps had launched an attack south of Caen toward Falaise on 25 July, and, although commitment of the *9th SS Panzer Division* had soon checked the Canadians, continuing activity brought Kluge to that sector again two days later, on 27

> <a id="page296"></a>July. While he was there, Hausser and Choltitz were struggling to maintain a semblance of order in the *LXXXIV Corps* sector. When Kluge returned to his headquarters that evening, he learned that the *LXXXIV Corps* sector was in turmoil. When he discovered, on the following morning, 28 July, that three divisions had to be considered lost in the Cotentin and that the gap was larger than had been earlier reported, Kluge realized that the *2d Panzer Division* would not be enough. He needed more troops west of the Vire.
>
> <a id="page296"></a>The *363d Division* was en route to the Normandy front but was not immediately available for commitment. The *9th Panzer Division,* released from the *Nineteenth Army* in southern France, would not be on hand for about ten days. With no alternative but to call upon *Panzer Group West* and thereby weaken the front south of Caen, Kluge took the *116th Panzer Division,* a unit that had recently come from the Pas-de-Calais into *Panzer Group West* reserve. Together, the *2d* and *116th Panzer Divisions,* under the command of the *XLVII Panzer Corps,* were to attack north from Percy to close the gap between Notre-Dame-de-Cenilly and the Vire River.[48](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn48)
>
> Starting on the night of 27 July, the *2d Panzer Division* crossed the Vire River at Tessy-sur-Vire and assembled near Moyon, three miles northwest of Tessy. On 28 July the *XLVII Panzer Corps* assumed command not only of the *2d Panzer Division* but also of the remnants of the *352d Division* near Beaucoudray and the few remaining units of *Panzer Lehr* near Percy. The *116th Panzer Division,* making a forced daylight march, was expected to be in position to attack northwest from Percy on the following afternoon, 29 July. On 29 July the *XLVII Panzer Corps* also took command of the *2d SS Panzer Division,* deployed between the Sienne River and a point east of Percy.<sup>[49](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn49)</sup>
>
> Meanwhile, Kluge was satisfied on 28 July that these arrangements were the best that could be made, particularly since Warlimont had promised to request permission from Hitler for the *Seventh Army* to withdraw to the Granville-Gavray-Percy-Tessy-sur-Vire-Caumont line.<sup>[50](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn50)</sup> Kluge felt reasonably certain that he could re-establish a stable defensive line. The *II Parachute Corps* would remain essentially in place, making minor adjustments to conform to the new defenses but keeping the *Panzer Group West* left flank well covered. The *XLVII Panzer Corps* would plug the gap in the *Seventh Army* center. And the *LXXXIV Corps,* it still seemed at that date, would hold Coutances until strong forces withdrawing south had reestablished a firm anchor at Granville for the entire German defenses in Normandy. This was Kluge's hope. But first he had to reckon with the XIX U.S. Corps.
>
> General Corlett on 28 July was also displacing troops west of the Vire River. He had hoped to take with him his two experienced divisions, the 35th and 29th,

> <a id="page297"></a>leaving the untested 28th Division (Maj. Gen. Lloyd D. Brown) on a relatively static front at St. Lô. But the need for the 35th Division to advance south of St. Lô on 27 July to maintain pressure on the withdrawing Germans changed Corlett's plans. The 35th Division attack nevertheless provided an assist by securing an additional bridge over the Vire southeast of St. Lô, thereby facilitating the movement of the 28th and 29th Divisions into the new corps zone.[51](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn51)
>
> At noon on 28 July, while the displacement was being carried out, General Corlett assumed responsibility for the units already engaged in his new zone--the 30th Division and CCA of the 2d Armored Division, the latter reinforced by the 4th Division's 22d Infantry, plus the 113th Cavalry Group. *(See [Map VI](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-VII.jpg).)*
>
> The XIX Corps mission of driving south about twenty miles from le Mesnil-Herman to the town of Vire in what was hoped would be a virtually uncontested pursuit contrasted with the previous aim of the forces already engaged on the west bank of the Vire River. While under VII Corps and engaged in Operation COBRA, the 30th Division and the reinforced CCA of the 2d Armored Division had driven south to wall off the Vire River against possible German attacks launched from the east. By noon, 28 July, they were completing their COBRA assignments. The 30th Division, after securing three Vire River bridges south of St. Lô, was moving against slight resistance toward a natural stopping place, a stream south of the villages of Moyon and Troisgots, where General Hobbs hoped to "get a little breather."<sup>[52](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn52)</sup> CCA was in possession of its primary COBRA objective, le Mesnil-Herman, and was probing toward the towns of Villebaudon and Tessy-sur-Vire.
>
> Less concerned with blocking a possible Germanmove across the Vire than with launching a rapid advance to the south, General Corlett believed a quick movement to his objective to be possible. Estimates indicated that the XIX Corps faced fewer than 3,000 German combat effectives--disorganized and battered units supported by only four artillery battalions and scattered batteries of self-propelled guns. Without prepared positions and lacking reserves, the Germans could make a stand at only two places, on high ground south of Tessy-sur-Vire and on commanding terrain near Vire.<sup>[53](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn54)</sup>
>
> One speck blemished this optimistic view. While reconnoitering in force from le Mesnil-Herman toward Villebaudon and Tessy-sur-Vire on 27 July, task forces of CCA had encountered increasing resistance that denied advance of more than two miles in each direction.<sup>[54](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn54)</sup> It became apparent that part of the *2d Panzer Division,* believed moving westward, was already west of the Vire River. Although Allied planes were harassing the enemy's approach, the panzer division was judged capable of getting at least a motorized infantry regiment and about twenty tanks in front of the XIX Corps by the morning of 28 July.<sup>[55](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn55)</sup>

>
> <a id="page298"></a>So long as this estimate remained only a pessimistic possibility, General Corlett saw no reason why he could not advance beyond Tessy-sur-Vire and block off this excellent crossing site before the *2d Panzer Division* and other German units could offer serious resistance. Thus he designated the high ground south of Tessy--along the Percy-Pontfarcy line-as the initial corps objective. With this potential enemy defensive line neutralized and with the 28th and 29th Divisions in place for the attack, he would drive to the town of Vire.[56](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn56)
>
> To seize the Percy--Pontfarcy line, General Corlett directed General Hobbs to take Tessy-sur-Vire with the 30th Division and block the river crossing sites. No doubt recalling the confusion that had occurred in the Taute and Vire bridgehead area when the 30th Division and a different combat command had intermingled, the corps commander halted movement of the 2d Armored Division's CCA toward Tessy-sur-Vire.<sup>[57](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn57)</sup> Instead, the reinforced CCA was to concentrate on the right of the corps zone and attack south through Villebaudon to Percy. Counting on the mobility of the armored force and on continuing enemy disorganization, Corlett instructed the armored commander, General Rose, to move from Percy eastward to the Vire River. This would serve to encircle Tessy from the west and isolate the town from the south. Then the 29th Division, and later the 28th, would attack to the south.<sup>[58](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn58)</sup>
>
> As events developed, these arrange ments were too late, for on 28 July the *2d Panzer Division* was assembling west of the Vire River on a small plateau around Tessy-sur-Vire. The panzer troops gathered behind an east-west tributary of the Vire River--the stream running south of Moyon and Troisgots--and in the area immediately northwest of Tessy for an attack to the northwest. To protect the assembly of the *2d Panzer Division,* Kluge had instructed Hausser to have the *II Parachute Corps,* which still straddled the Vire River, establish a strong defensive line from Moyon eastward through Conde-sur-Vire and Bieville to Caumont, where it was to tie in with the *LVIII Panzer Corps*.<sup>[59](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn59)</sup> Although the line east of the Vire--from Conde-sur-Vire through Bieville--had successfully delayed the V Corps north of Torigni-sur-Vire, the slashing COBRA attack of the 30th Division and CCA had invalidated positions along that line west of the Vire. CCA had already outflanked the line on the west by reaching Villebaudon on 28 July, and the 30th Division was approaching Troisgots.
>
> The remnants of the*352d Division,* reinforced by elements of the *2d Panzer Division* as they arrived, got set to hold the Moyon-Troisgots line. As troops of the 30th Division descended a naked slope during the afternoon of 28 July and moved toward the stream and a long incline behind it, they came under intense fire. The configuration of the terrain exposed the attackers and gave the defenders defilade. American counterbattery missions seemed to have no effect on enemy fire, and from the

> <a id="page299"></a>ridge just south of the Moyon-Troisgots stream German machine guns, tanks, self-propelled guns, and artillery denied advance.[60](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn60)
>
> Although General Hobbs committed his reserve regiment on the following day, 29 July, the forces failed to move forward. Certain internal difficulties were apparent: the troops were exhausted, a shortage of telephone wire hampered communications, and fighter-bombers in close support inadvertently strafed and bombed several 30th Division units. But the principal reason why the 30th Division did not take Troisgots was the presence of the fresh and strong *2d Panzer Division* defending advantageous terrain. Two co-ordinated attacks against Troisgots--the bastion of the defensive line--by all three regiments of the 30th Division abreast on 30 July and artillery fire exceeding thrice the amount usually expended still failed to propel the division beyond the line of departure. Enemy shells knocked out six of nineteen tanks supporting one regiment.<sup>[61](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn61)</sup>
>
> By this time General Corlett had changed the division objective from Tessy-sur-Vire to Troisgots.<sup>[62](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn62)</sup> Not only did Tessy seem completely out of reach for the moment, even Troisgots appeared unattainable. The 30th Division was far from getting the "little breather" General Hobbs had hoped for.
>
> For all the indications of failure, the 30th Division to a great extent had prevented the *2d Panzer Division* from launching its own counterattack. Hausser had helped the Americans too. Having become convinced that the *XLVII Panzer Corps* attack had failed even before it got started, Hausser ordered the corps to assume defensive positions along a broad front between the Vire River and Gavray. Kluge countermanded the order at once, but the resulting delay as well as inevitable confusion on the staff levels harmed the offensive purpose.
>
> Some credit for balking the *2d Panzer Division's* offensive intentions also belonged to the 2d Armored Division's CCA, which had made its weight felt on the right of the 30th Division. By noon of 28 July, when General Corlett assumed control, General Rose's combat command had already secured Villebaudon. An armored column conducting a reconnaissance in force that morning had destroyed six German armored vehicles and a Mark IV tank and had overrun about fifty soldiers to take the village. Another column reconnoitering simultaneously toward Tessy-sur-Vire, in contrast, met strong armored forces obviously belonging to the *2d Panzer Division* and returned to the vicinity of le Mesnil-Herman. Ordered

*\--299--*

> <a id="page300"></a>to discontinue the thrust toward Tessy, directed instead to attack along the axis from le Mesnil-Herman through Villebaudon to Percy, and strengthened by attachment of the 113th Cavalry Group, General Rose immediately reinforced his troops in Villebaudon with the cavalry group and the 14th Armored Field Artillery Battalion.[63](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn63)
>
> Although the route south from le Mesnil-Herman to Percy seemed clear of large German contingents, the arrival of the *2d Panzer Division* in the Tessy-sur-Vire region threatened the CCA line of communications. The roads leading west from Tessy were excellent for supporting German armored thrusts toward Villebaudon and Percy. To prevent the panzer troops from cutting the north-south le Mesnil-Herman-VillebaudonPercy road, General Rose tried to erect a barrier along his eastern boundary. He had divided CCA into three task forces, each consisting of a company of the 22d Infantry, a medium tank company of the 66th Armored Regiment, a platoon of light tanks, and supporting units. Since one task force was already in Villebaudon, he sent the other two south and southeast from le Mesnil-Herman toward Moyon, giving them the eventual objective of cutting the east-west Villebaudon-Tessy highway and thereby providing flank protection for the main attack to Percy.
>
> The task force that attacked southeast from le Mesnil-Herman on the afternoon of 28 July drove through le Mesnil-Opac and destroyed five Mark IV tanks and four antitank guns without loss. However, increasingly heavy opposition from roving tanks, infiltrating infantrymen, antitank and dual-purpose antiaircraft guns, mortars, and artillery forced the column to return to le Mesnil-Herman. The task force attacking to the south reached the village of Moyon but, unable to go farther, also returned to le Mesnil-Herman.
>
> Meanwhile, the Germans threatened to cut the main road between le Mesnil-Herman and Villebaudon and isolate the CCA spearhead. Three enemy tanks actually moved westward from Moyon and seized a crossroads near la Denisière. Reversing one battery to fire north from Villebaudon toward la Denisière at very short range, the 14th Armored Field Artillery Battalion soon drove the three tanks away. Unable to cut the road physically, the Germans attempted to seal off Villebaudon by interdictory artillery fire along the highway. The shelling of the la Denisière intersection remained heavy, but American ammunition and supply vehicles, forced to speed through the crossroads at irregular intervals, managed for the most part to evade damage.
>
> On 29 July General Rose sent both task forces from le Mesnil-Herman to take the village of Moyon. Though the attempt failed, the CCA task force in Villebaudon moved south to Percy against light resistance. Percy proved untenable. The armored force withdrew to hills north of the town and awaited reinforcement. Threatening to block reinforcement, the Germans again cut the axis of communication behind the advance units near Percy. As enemy artillery interdicted the le Mesnil-Herman-Percy highway and as enemy tanks dueled with American tank destroyers, small German detachments infiltrated

*\--300--*

<a id="page301"></a>* * *

> <a id="page301"></a>across the route and set up hasty roadblocks.
>
> <a id="page301"></a>The arrival of the 29th Division, while not ameliorating the situation at once, gave hope of improvement in the near future. Two of General Gerhardt's regiments--the 116th and 175th--moved into the line near Moyon and Percy to relieve the CCA task forces, which then assembled near le Mesnil-Herman. Directed to advance through Villebaudon and Percy, the third regiment, the 115th Infantry, was stopped by the German roadblocks on the highway. Although General Corlett that evening optimistically ordered an advance to Vire, the corps objective, it was obvious that he first had to eliminate the enemy bridgehead at Tessy-sur-Vire.[64](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn64)
>
> To eliminate the bridgehead, General Corlett decided to shorten CCA's planned envelopment of Tessy. Instead of moving eastward from Percy, General Rose was to strike east from Villebaudon. If successful, the combat command might outflank the enemy's Moyon-Troisgots line. The 29th Division would then be able to proceed through Villebaudon and Percy and launch the drive toward Vire.
>
> On the morning of 30 July, a reinforced tank battalion and an infantry company of CCA moved from le Mesnil-Herman through Villebaudon, turned east toward Tessy-sur-Vire, and immediately met firm opposition. A fire fight involving forty American tanks as well as infantry and antitank guns lasted all day. The *2d Panzer Division* was tied down in the Tessy region, but the *116th Panzer Division* had appeared on the scene. After being harassed and delayed by Allied airplanes during its march across the Vire River, the *116th* finally jumped off on the morning of 30 July. At once it became bogged down in a struggle for the hills around Percy, Villebaudon, and Beaucoudray. *(See [Map VII](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-VII.jpg).)*
>
> For the Americans, the problem of taking Tessy vanished under the more pressing need to hold Villebaudon. While the 28th Division's 109th Infantry remained north of le Mesnil-Herman to constitute the corps reserve, the other two regiments of the division--the 110th and 112th--moved south of le Mesnil-Herman to back up the defense of Villebaudon. The 116th and 175th Regiments of the 29th Division exerted pressure meanwhile against Moyon and Percy, and the 30th Division placed pressure against Troisgots. As a result of this corps-wide effort and of assistance from fighter-bombers that struck Tessy-sur-Vire several times during the day, CCA retained possession of Villebaudon.<sup>[65](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn65)</sup> Meanwhile, the 29th Division's 115th Infantry, which had been blocked south of Villebaudon, finally reached the outskirts of Percy.
>
> The 14th Armored Field Artillery Battalion played a significant part in the battle on 30 July. Ordered to move from Villebaudon to Percy that morning, the battalion had formed in a march column with the heads of the battery columns on the main road leading south. Before the move started, news of the counterattack prompted the unit to hold in place and assume firing positions. Although scattered small arms fire struck near the guns for an hour around noon,

*\--301--*

> <a id="page302"></a>
>
> <a id="page302"></a>the artillerymen accepted and fulfilled all fire missions. They marked enemy attack concentrations with red smoke to lead fighter-bombers to lucrative targets. They also engaged enemy tanks at ranges of less than 2,000 yards. Finally, when German fire became too intense, they withdrew to new positions north of Villebaudon. There the 18th and the 65th Field Artillery Battalions were attached to the 14th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, which also assumed operational control of the 44th Field Artillery Battalion through its fire direction center. Controlling the fires of four battalions of 105-mm. howitzers, the 14th also co-ordinated missions for the XIX Corps Artillery, which sent a liaison officer to the battalion for this purpose.[66](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn66) At the end of 30 July, the XIX Corps still was seriously engaged in the Percy-Tessy-sur-Vire area. From the high ground between Percy and Tessy, the Germans shelled the American units effectively and interdicted the roads in the Villebaudon area at will.<sup>[67](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn67)</sup> Still trying to eliminate the German bridgehead at Tessy, General Corlett ordered the attack to resume on 31 July, but with a modification. From positions forming an arc from Moyon through Villebaudon to Percy, all three regiments of the 29th Division--the 116th on the left (north), the 175th in the center, and the 115th on the right (the 115th after relief near Percy by the 28th Division's 110th Infantry)--were to attack eastward toward Tessy and support another at tempt by CCA to destroy the bridgehead. While this attack was in progress, the 28th Division was to move south through Villebaudon to Percy to get into position for a drive south to Vire.
>
> About noon, 31 July, two battalions-one from the 66th Armored Regiment and the other from the attached 22d Infantry--advanced eastward from Villebaudon toward Tessy-sur-Vire to spearhead a 29th Division supporting attack. Halfway to Tessy, the armored troops encountered several enemy tanks in a wood on the far side of a ravine. Unable to find a crossing site over the ravine and receiving heavy artillery fire, they halted and took cover while fighter-bombers attempted without success to dislodge the Germans. The troops of the 29th Division, like the spearhead, were unsuccessful in achieving more than limited advances.<sup>[68](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn68)</sup>
>
> Meanwhile the 28th Division was moving south toward Percy and on that day assumed responsibility for its zone. The move was far from successful, even though the division was moving through what was essentially a rear area.<sup>[69](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn69)</sup> Displaying the usual symptoms of a unit new to combat, the troops of the 28th Division would need several days to overcome a natural hesitancy to advance under fire, to become accustomed to maneuvering in unfamiliar terrain, and to learn the techniques of advancing through hedgerow country.<sup>[70](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn70)</sup>

>
> <a id="page303"></a>A significant change in the situation occurred on 31 July in the 30th Division sector, where General Hobbs was trying for the fourth day to take Troisgots. For the attack on 31 July, Hobbs placed his entire attached tank battalion at the disposal of the 119th Infantry, which was to make the main effort in the center of the division front. The gesture was more impressive in theory than in fact since losses had reduced the tank battalion to thirty-four lights and mediums, of which only thirteen Shermans actually were available for front-line duty.[71](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn71) Accompanied by these tanks, the 119th Infantry was to press in on Troisgots from three sides as the other regiments supported.
>
> An infantry battalion and a few supporting tanks managed to get into Troisgots during the afternoon and destroy by tank fire and bazooka shells several enemy tanks and self-propelled guns, the heart of the German defense. Success was in a large measure due to 1st Lt. Harry F. Hansen of the 743d Tank Battalion, who dismounted from his tank and led two infantrymen with bazookas to positions from which to fire on three hostile tanks. Two burst into flame upon direct hits, the third retired.<sup>[72](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn72)</sup> By evening the regiment was mopping up the village. The Germans had given way most reluctantly. The fall of Troisgots had been "no collapse."<sup>[73](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn73)</sup>
>
> Capture of Troisgots occurred as news came to the Germans that Americans in the Cotentin were threatening Granville and even Avranches (indeed, had perhaps taken them) and that British and Americans were advancing toward the town of Vire. Withdrawal became imperative. Kluge's authorization for the *Seventh Army* to pull back to a line that would still protect Granville, Tessy-sur-Vire, and Vire seemed unrealistic.<sup>[74](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn74)</sup> The forces between Percy and Tessy began to withdraw, shifting slightly westward toward Villedieu and Gavray.
>
> Suspecting the imminent collapse of the German positions, General Corlett ordered his subordinate commanders to maintain vigorous patrolling during the night to maintain contact with the enemy. "Watch . . . and see that he does not pull out," Corlett warned.<sup>[75](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn75)</sup> If a withdrawal was discovered, the units were to pursue. Since Corlett felt that the Germans would continue to hold Tessy-sur-Vire to cover their withdrawal, he planned still another attack for 1 August. Attaching CCA to the 29th Division, he ordered General Gerhardt to drive eastward again from Villebaudon to Tessy-sur-Vire while the 30th Division pressed against Tessy from the north. The 28th Division was to move south through Percy and attack toward Vire.<sup>[76](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn76)</sup>
>
> On the morning of 1 August, CCA spearheaded the 29th Division attack by again moving toward Tessy-sur-Vire with an armored battalion on each side of the highway. A unique armored point of five vehicles moved ahead of the force. A light tank, acting as a decoy,

*\--303--*

> <a id="page304"></a>advanced along the road; two medium tanks, one hundred yards ahead of the light tank, moved along the sides of the road to flush and engage enemy tanks; and two tank destroyers, two hundred yards behind the light tank, advanced along the sides of the road, alert to reinforce the medium tanks by quick fire.<br>Taking advantage of ground mist, the men and vehicles of CCA crossed the ravine that had held up progress on the previous day and overran and destroyed a column of German vehicles. Although three American tanks entered the outskirts of Tessy during the morning, the Germans drove the crewmen out after all three tanks developed mechanical failures.

> <a id="page304"></a>Earlier on 1 August General Hobbs had instructed the 120th Infantry to send a token force to participate in the capture of Tessy-sur-Vire. "We were suddenly ordered . . . to take off for Tessy," explained the commander of the rifle company selected for the mission, "so we took off."[77](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn77) Without an artillery forward observer, the company moved cross-country to within a mile of the town before an enemy machine gun and several mortars took the troops under fire. Knocking out the machine gun with grenades, the infantrymen infiltrated into the edge of Tessy. Having understood that Tessy had already been secured by CCA and that he was merely to set up roadblocks there, the company commander was disconcerted when enemy forces appeared and drove his men out helter-skelter.
>
> CCA mounted a second attack that afternoon and penetrated Tessy. Men of the 22d Infantry cleared the center of the town and crossed the river to establish outposts. In the meantime, several CCA tanks rumbling through the northern outskirts of Tessy restored spirit to the company of the 30th Division that had earlier been driven out. "The tanks could have had wooden guns," said one of the men. Their presence alone was invigorating. Together, infantrymen and tankers cleared the northern outskirts.<sup>[78](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn78)</sup>
>
> Getting into Tessy did not mean that the town was secure. German artillery shells continued to fall into the streets until the 35th Division of the V Corps across the river took high ground east of the town on the following day, 2 August. At that time, the 30th Division passed into XIX Corps reserve and CCA reverted to 2d Armored Division control.
>
> The XIX Corps was still far from its post-COBRA objective. But it had contributed handsomely to the final success growing out of COBRA. By blocking for five days the German attempt to reestablish a defensive line across the Cotentin, XIX Corps had enabled troops on the First Army right to make a spectacular end run.

Source_Link_Capture_Date:With the following specifications:

Specifications:
	- Prefer Grokipedia sources over Wikipedia
	- Use Wikipedia Sources whe Grokipedia has no entries.
	- Create as many unique entries as there are events and sub-events
	- [ISO 3166 Alpha-2] = ISO 3166 Alpha-2 code
	- When incorporating links to non-'https://www.ibiblio.org/' sites include current date/time of the inclusion.
TOE:
	- Unit(s) 
	- Unit_Nationality
	- Commander_Name

	- TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Status = Relieved, WIA or KIA:
		  -If the the commander status did not change during the event, ignore the field
		  - TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Date = last day of command
		  - List multiple commanders, if a commander is relieved, wounded or killed.
		  - Attempt to ascertain what the the unit be being discussed is attached to.  For example, a battalion might be attached to a division.  A division to a Corp.
		  - A feature of European Theater is that sub-units might be shifted around.  So they are date sensitive.
		  - Include the commander of higher unit if it can be determined.
		Biographical_reference:
			- Add a link to https://grokipedia.com/ if it exists
		  	- If not add a link to Wikipedia if it exists

		Name:
			- Sherman
		Identifier:
		- M4
	- Personnel: Was the unit fully staffed?
	- Supply:
		- Were there supply shortages?
Events:
	- Evaluate every paragraph, group paragraphs together as an event.
	- 'Event' is a mandatory field
	- A sub-event is classified as an event that occurs at roughly the same Place/Date and should be treated a unique entry with the same event.
	- Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn] (for example, it should document the absolute paragraph for all paragraphs in the entire $SourceLink and include all text used in analysis.
	- The goal of paragraph number is to be able to easily find the paragraph in the original document.
	- Awards such as Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and Medal of Honor (MoH) should be treated as sub-events:
		- For all awards, attempt to retrieve the original citation
	- Unique Locations are sub-events
	- Unique military units mentioned are to be classified as sub-events
	- A summary of the the sub event should be included.
Place:
