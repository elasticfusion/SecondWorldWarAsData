> ### *East of the Vire River*
>
> While the British were preparing to join the offensive east of the Vire, the V Corps resumed the attack. Assuming responsibility for all the American-held territory east of the Vire on 28 July by taking control of the 35th Division, General Gerow had free rein to push the V Corps to the south in the general direction of the town of Vire. Though General Bradley had assigned him no specific objectives, Bradley had asked him to keep the army headquarters informed on his intentions and progress. To his three divisions--the 2d, 5th, and 35th--General Gerow stated his mission as he understood it: "We *must* keep going to maintain contact, and not give the Boche a chance to dig in. See that all understand this."<sup>[25](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn25)</sup>
>
> As the opposing *II Parachute Corps* pulled back in the hope of establishing defenses that could be tied in with the line the German units west of the Vire were trying to form, the V Corps on 28 July secured its COBRA objective, the St. Jean-des-Baisants ridge from Ste. Suzanne-sur-Vire to Vidouville. All three divisions advanced against light resistance and captured few prisoners. Although the enemy seemed much weaker as a result of the three-day attack and thus made prospects of a virtually unlimited advance seem possible for the V Corps, General Gerow was reluctant to initiate an unrestrained attack because of the terrain and his left flank. (*See [Map VI.](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-VI.jpg))*
>
> The Souloeuvre-Vire river line, eleven miles beyond the St. Jean-des-Baisants ridge, appeared the obvious V Corps objective. Although the water alone constituted an obstacle to vehicular movement, the river runs through a ridge mass more than two miles in depth that presented an even more serious barrier to military advance. Steep-walled hills from 600 to 900 feet high would provide the Germans dominant observation, cover and concealment, fields of fire, and a good communications network. Hoping to secure the area before the Germans could organize it for defense, General Gerow nevertheless felt that the intervening terrain precluded a rapid advance. In the heart of the *bocage* country, the corps sector east of the Vire was a region of small irregular hills, small winding roads, and small hedgerowed fields. Combat there was sure to resemble the earlier battle of the hedgerows in the Cotentin.<sup>[26](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn26)</sup>

> <a id="page291"></a>The second factor working against an unchecked V Corps advance was General Gerow's concern over his left flank. Until the British attacked south from Caumont on 30 July (prevented until then by difficulties of regrouping and deployment) and covered the flank, a headlong advance by V Corps would expose an increasingly vulnerable side to the enemy.
>
> <a id="page291"></a>General Gerow's solution for his two problems was to set limits on his advance in order to keep tight control.[27](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn27)
>
> The Germans facilitated the V Corps advance when the *II Parachute Corps,* with permission, pulled back again.<sup>[28](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn28)</sup> Moving to the first limit of advance with very little difficulty, V Corps by noon 29 July held a line from Conde-sur-Vire to the British positions near Caumont. When the corps commander ordered the attack continued, troops pushed forward again for several thousand yards against sporadic resistance.<sup>[29](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn29)</sup>
>
> Despite the absence of an organized German defensive line, the V Corps divisions did not have an easy time. The terrain inhibited rapid advance, and ambush lurked around every twist in the road. The *bocage* hills were populated by German rear-guard parties who used artillery, mortars, and small arms fire effectively. One American regimental commander, apparently near exhaustion, reported, "Things are not going very well," and said he "would like to be relieved of command." The division commander was not sympathetic. "I will relieve you when I get ready to do so," he snapped, but later sought to soothe him: "Do not get discouraged," he said, "this is hedgerow fighting. It is tough."<sup>[30](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn30)</sup>
>
> Receiving word that the Germans were withdrawing all along the First Army front and learning that the British were planning to attack on the following day, General Gerow on 29 July ordered his division commanders into an all-out advance. Instead of merely preventing disengagement, the corps was to "drive strong and hard" in "a relentless pursuit."<sup>[31](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn31)</sup> As translated by General Robertson, the troops were to "by-pass everything. Never mind these little pockets of resistance. . . . Let's get down and take a bath in the Vire."<sup>[32](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn32)</sup> *([Map VII](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-VII.jpg) )*
>
> The instructions came too late. Though army headquarters claimed that only some "tired old Austrians" were in opposition, the troops had moved into contact with a defensive line covering an important road net centering on Torigni-sur-Vire. As the 35th Division on 30 July tried to take Torigni and the 2d and 5th Division to occupy high ground east of the village, the Germans inflicted close to 1,000 casualties, halted the advance,

> <a id="page282"></a>and dashed American hopes for an immediate pursuit.[33](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn33)
>
> To breach the new line, the subordinate units of the V Corps made detailed attack plans, only to discover as they prepared to launch a co-ordinated offensive on the morning of 31 July that the Germans had disengaged.<sup>[34](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn34)</sup> Kluge had authorized the *II Parachute Corps* to withdraw.<sup>[35](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn35)</sup> In falling back, the Germans abandoned not only the Torigni road net but also terrain that was highly defensible. Only mines and sporadic harassing artillery fire opposed an uninterrupted advance. American troops cheerfully advanced across undefended ground, while their commanders chafed at the thought of the enemy slipping away undetected.<sup>[36](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn36)</sup>
>
> Although all concerned pressed for speedy pursuit, the pace of the V Corps advance slowed during the afternoon of 31 July. Nearing the Souloeuvre-Vire water line, the corps encountered pockets of resistance and delaying forces with increasing frequency. The pursuit again threatened to come to a halt.
>
> The boundaries delineating the corps zone of advance met near the town of Vire, f ourteen miles southwest of Torigni. If the British on the left and the XIX Corps on the right advanced as projected, the V Corps would be pinched out near Vire.<sup>[37](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn37)</sup> Blocking the approach to the V Corps limit of advance was the east-west Vire-Souloeuvre river line and hill mass, seven miles north of Vire.
>
> These factors generally and a conversation with General Bradley specifically governed General Gerow's desire to cross the hills and the water barriers quickly.<sup>[38](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn38)</sup> Earlier on 31 July, Gerow had instructed his division commanders to move only as far as the river line. Later in the afternoon he ordered each division commander to get at least one battalion of each front-line regiment across the river before dark.
>
> On the corps right and in its center, the 35th and 2d Divisions met such strong resistance on the approaches to the water line--and particularly near Tessy-sur-Vire--that it became obvious that they could not comply with instructions.<sup>[39](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn39)</sup> On the other hand, the 5th Division on the left met relatively light resistance, indicating that a hard push might gain a bridgehead across the stream.
>
> Unable to reach General Irwin, the 5th Division commander, personally, Gerow phoned one of Irwin's regimental commanders and told him to mount his infantry on tanks. They were to bypass resistance, use only good roads, and get to the water and across it in at least battalion

"In short," Gerow commanded, "hurry."[40](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn40) Half an hour later he explained to Irwin, "I told you before to stop at the river--now I want you to change that." The 5th Division was to cover the more than six miles to the river line in record time.<sup>[41](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn41)</sup>
>
> Less than an hour after Gerow forwarded these instructions, he learned that a British armored division had attacked to the southwest, entered the V Corps zone, and secured two bridges across the river. "Well now, I don't like British walking across our front \[and\] taking \[our\] objectives," General Gerow complained.<sup>[42](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn42)</sup> But since the British had already secured a bridgehead he saw no reason why the Americans could not use it, specifically the 5th Division, for a quick drive across the remaining seven miles to the town of Vire.<sup>[43](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn43)</sup>
>
> Unfortunately, the intermingling of British tanks and American infantrymen caused confusion. The opportunity for an immediate exploitation by either the British or the Americans was lost.<sup>[44](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn44)</sup> One regiment of the 5th Division reached the north bank of the Souloeuvre River during the early morning hours of 1 August. There it remained throughout the day, out of contact much of the time with other division units.
>
> By then, however, after having advanced more than seven miles in six days, the corps had reached the end of what had earlier promised to develop into an unlimited pursuit. On 1 August, as the 35th and 2d Divisions fought near Tessy-sur-Vire to get to the Souloeuvre-Vire line, the boundary separating the British and Americans was moved to the west, thereby narrowing the V Corps sector and pinching out the entire 5th Division.
>
> Part of the reason for the boundary change was the success of the British attack south from Caumont. In compliance with Montgomery's endeavor to deny the Germans the pivot point near Mont Pinçon, General Dempsey had launched the 8 Corps in Operation BLUECOAT on 30 July. Following a bombardment by 700 heavy bombers and 500 medium and light bombers that dropped 2,200 tons of high explosive, the British attacked a sector that was lightly defended. Only the bombed and inexperienced *326th Infantry Division* stood in the way. On the first day of the attack, the 11th British Armoured Division advanced six to eight miles to come abreast of the V Corps east of Torigni-sur-Vire. Operations on 31 July were hampered by the terrain: by the pronounced ridges running across the axis of advance; by the streams, which flowed in all directions and which in many cases were tank obstacles because of their width, depth, or marshy approaches; and by the tortuous roads, which were often banked by high hedges. But these difficulties were quickly overcome when the British discovered

> <a id="page295"></a>that the For&ecurc;t l'Evêque, which was astride the boundary between the *Seventh Army* and *Panzer Group West,* had through oversight been left unoccupied by the Germans. A vital stretch of some 1,500 yards of country was theirs for the taking. Thrusting through the forest, the 11th Armoured Division quickly gained the south bank of the Souloeuvre River and by 1 August occupied high ground immediately east of the Vire.[45](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn45)
