> their effort. Accompanied by surprise, the attack raised the specter of catastrophe. Loss of Mortain was a serious blow.
>
> A town of 1,600 inhabitants, Mortain is at the foot of a rocky hill rising just to the east--Hill 317. The hill is the southern spur of wooded highland, convulsed and broken terrain around Sourdeval called by tourist bureaus "la Suisse normande" (Norman Switzerland). Near the juncture of the ancient provinces of Normandy, Brittany, and Maine, Hill 317 provides a magnificent view of the flat tableland to the south and west--the Sélune River plain, which is crossed by ribbons of road and stream. Domfront, fifteen miles eastward, and the bay of Mont St. Michel, twenty miles to the west, are visible on clear days. After the 1st Division had entered Mortain without difficulty on 3 August, the VII Corps commander, General Collins, inspected the positions and pointed to the high ground east of Mortain.
>
> "Ralph," he told the 1st Division commander, "be sure to get Hill 317." "Joe," General Huebner replied, "I already have it."<sup>[21](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn21)</sup>
>
> On 6 August the 30th Division occupied Mortain to free the 1st Division and its attached CCA of the 3d Armored Division for displacement south to Mayenne and exploitation east toward Alençon. Although the 1st Division was then rather far from VII Corps supply dumps (too long a run, General Collins thought, for effective supply),
>
> Collins, who like the entire Allied command at the time was thinking in terms of the offensive, expected to move the corps beyond Mortain in short order. While the 4th Division remained in corps reserve near St. Pois, the 9th Division was to attack through Gathemo and Sourdeval, and the 30th Division was to push east toward Barenton and Domfront. There was no intimation that a German counterattack would upset these plans.<sup>[22](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn22)</sup>
>
> Questions had been raised a week earlier--"Will the enemy counterattack against the VII Corps south of the Sée River? . . . Will the enemy counterattack against the left flank of the Corps? . . . Where and in what strength will the VII Corps encounter organized resistance?" But the answers were as anti-climactic as they appeared obvious. The corps G-2 estimated 5,400 combat effectives in opposition; a parachute division and an infantry division, each with 1,000 combat effectives, were the strongest units he believed to be on the corps front.<sup>[23](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn23)</sup> The Germans could hardly offer serious resistance. The stubborn opposition in the Villedieu-les-Poëles and Gathemo sectors during the first days of August was apparently nothing more than rear-guard action covering a general withdrawal.
>
> The 30th Division, because of traffic snarls, did not reach Mortain until six or seven hours after the planned time, and General Hobbs took responsibility for the sector at 2000, 6 August, four hours before the German counterattack started. His primary mission was to defend

> the front from St. Barthélemy through Mortain to Barenton. Since the first two villages were in American hands, he set out to take the third. Because a small task force (attached tanks from CCA of the 3d Armored Division) of the 1st Division was to have taken Barenton that evening, Hobbs sent an infantry battalion (less one company but augmented by a company of medium tanks and a reconnaissance platoon) to relieve the armor at Barenton. Soon after this force departed Mortain, enemy aircraft strafed the column, destroyed several trucks, caused twenty-five casualties, and delayed the advance for an hour. Being attacked by German planes was a rather rare occurrence, but it did not necessarily signal portentous events; the column continued. When the men of the 30th Division made contact with CCA near Barenton, they learned that the armored troops had held the village but briefly before being expelled. Joining forces, the two units prepared to attack Barenton on the following morning, the 7th.<sup>[24](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn24)</sup>
>
> General Hobbs was also to attack toward Domfront, and he planned to send a reinforced infantry regiment there on 7 August. His G-2 also raised questions: Would the Germans defend high ground north of Barenton, high ground east and north of Domfront, or the road to Domfront? Would the Germans counterattack between Chérencé-le-Roussel and Mortain?<sup>[25](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn25)</sup> The questions came somewhat late.
>
> Around midnight of 6 August, the VII Corps disseminated a warning that the Germans might counterattack near Mortain within the next twelve hours. Pilots had seen concentrations of German armor north and east of Sourdeval, forces thought to belong to the *1st SS, 2d,* and *116th Panzer Divisions.* If these units made a westward thrust to Avranches, they would cut the communications of those American forces operating south of the Sélune River. Until the threat either developed or vanished, the 30th Division was to postpone sending a regiment to Domfront; Hobbs was to move a battalion south of the Sélune to protect communications with the 1st Division; he was also to reinforce his troops on Hill 317 east of Mortain.<sup>[26](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn26)</sup> This, too, came too late.
>
> Activity on 7 August opened in the 1st Division zone near Mayenne during the early minutes of the day. Reconnaissance troops of the *9th Panzer Division* launched an attack that seemed for a few hours as though it might develop into something serious. Though Americans later connected this with the Mortain counterattack, the action around Mayenne was local in nature and unrelated, except perhaps most tenuously, to the major effort around Mortain.
>
> The German forces attacking at Mortain entered the 1st Division sector southeast of Barenton four and a half hours afterwards, about 0430, when six tanks and supporting infantry of the *2d SS Panzer Division* broke through a screen maintained by the 4th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron attached to

> the 1st Division. The consequences were not important. The cavalry withdrew several miles, consolidated forces, and established new lines.
> 
> Throughout the rest of the day the 1st Division, outside the critical German attack zone, remained in spotty contact with the enemy. Extensive patrolling to protect Mayenne and the corps lines of communication established a pattern of activity that was to be characteristic for several days. Meanwhile, the division waited for "orders to continue the exploitation" eastward toward Alençon.<sup>[27](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn27)</sup>

> of the division, the regiment was attacking northeastward from Chérencé to make contact with the 47th and 60th Regiments pushing southeastward in the Gathemo area. At midnight, 6 August, the Germans still held the intervening ground about Perriers-en-Beauficel.
>
> Shortly after midnight a forward observer of the 26th Field Artillery Battalion, which was supporting the 39th Infantry, heard tanks moving westward along the road between St. Barthélemy and Chérencé. The tank motors did not sound like Shermans. After establishing the fact that no American tanks were operating there, the artillery battalion, upon data furnished by the observer, began to fire at a range of five thousand yards but soon reduced it to only a thousand. By 0150, 7 August, not only the artillery battalion but also the infantry regiment was sure that a German armored column was moving west toward le Mesnil-Tôve.
>
> A platoon of the regimental cannon company in le Mesnil-Tôve concluded that the Germans were already too close for effective defense. Dismantling their guns and disabling their vehicles, the troops abandoned the village and rejoined the infantry. So that German activity might be reported accurately, the platoon leader stayed behind. After verifying the fact that at least twenty enemy tracked vehicles were moving westward, he reported thirty-five more vehicles in the vicinity, including personnel carriers from which infantrymen were unloading. At the same time, word came from the regimental switchboard at le Mesnil-Tôve that the village was under machine gun fire, that all American troops had departed, and that field trains and ammunition dumps nearby had been overrun and set afire.
>
> The regimental commander had taken his first action at 0250, 7 August, when he instructed one of the infantry battalions to switch its antitank defenses toward the south to protect the rear. Thirty minutes later he directed his reserve (an infantry company and several tank destroyers) to attack south from Chérencé to le Mesnil-Tôve in order to cut behind the German spearhead. When the attack made no headway out of Chérencé, it became apparent that the Germans had cut directly across the regimental axis of communication. All three infantry battalions were north of the German penetration. The regimental command post, the cannon company (less one platoon), the antitank company (less two gun platoons), and the firing batteries of the 26th Field Artillery Battalion were south of the German column.<sup>[28](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn28)</sup>
>
> The German attack struck the 30th Division more directly. The *2d SS Panzer Division* surged through Mortain, knocked out roadblocks manned by Col. Hammond D. Birks's 120th Infantry north and south of the village, overran the 2d Battalion command post in Mortain and drove the staff into hiding, and isolated the rifle battalion on Hill 317. The battalion, reinforced by a company of the 3d Battalion, had split a rifle company three ways to establish two roadblocks north of Mortain and one south of the village. One roadblock north of Mortain, augmented by a few antitank guns, remained in action and accounted for over forty enemy vehicles and tanks

*\--469--*

<a id="page470"></a>

* * *

> during the next few days. Two roadblocks were destroyed at once, the survivors making their way to the surrounded hilltop to join the three rifle companies, the heavy weapons company, and the several antitank pieces that occupied the most important terrain in the Mortain sector.
>
> Near St. Barthélemy, the Germans overran two companies of Lt. Col. Walter M. Johnson's 117th Infantry, surrounded a battalion headquarters, and threatened the regimental command post four hundred yards away. A patrol checking the outpost defenses of the regimental headquarters had suddenly been confronted by about fifty Germans. T. Sgt. Harold V. Sterling engaged the enemy while four companions maneuvered to safety. Then all five men conducted a fire fight for one hour until reinforcement arrived and the German group withdrew. In the belief that moving the regimental headquarters might have an adverse effect on morale, Colonel Johnson stayed to direct the battle in his sector, although he was virtually encircled.<sup>[29](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn29)</sup>
>
> Despite these initial blows, the 30th Division made no report to higher headquarters of the counterattack until 0315, 7 August, when German tanks were already in possession of Mortain and had reached a point four miles west of St. Barthélemy near le Mesnil-Tôve. Still the division G-3 was "not yet greatly concerned," even though he admitted that the Germans had cut behind the 39th Infantry in the Chérencé-Gathemo sector, penetrated four miles behind the 30th Division front, threatened to drive uncontested to Avranches, and might attain St. Hilaire and Ducey without interference. Unperturbed an hour and a half later, he promised that the penetration would be cleaned up at the first light of day. Passing these reports to the First Army, a staff officer at the VII Corps headquarters added that the penetrations appeared to have been made by "uncoordinated units attempting to escape rather than aggressive action." Everyone on the lower echelons, it appeared, was confident that the attacks "would be rapidly taken care of." The army headquarters was under the impression that the disturbance was a local infantry counterattack that was repulsed without difficulty. Not until the coming of dawn was it obvious that the German effort was serious, "heavier than was first thought, but . . . under control."<sup>[30](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn30)</sup>
>
> At daybreak on 7 August, Generals Hodges and Collins were highly conscious of the fact that the German counterattack at the least threatened the VII Corps, at the most menaced the entire bridgehead south of the Sélune. If the German forces north of Mortain thrust northward across the Sée River, they might run riot through the corps rear area, destroying supply installations and nullifying in great part the exploitation of COBRA.<sup>[31](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn31)</sup>
>
> Fortunately the 4th Division, in corps reserve and anticipating several days of rest and recreation, had reacted in a positive manner during the early morning

> hours. The 4th Division Artillery was placing a large volume of fire on German movements south of the Sée, and General Barton had assembled his troops for immediate commitment. By 0530 Barton was able to assure the corps commander that the Germans did not seem to be trying to go north of the Sée and that if they did, the 4th Division was ready.<sup>[32](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn32)</sup>
>
> Though reassured about the situation along the Sée River, General Collins was far from satisfied with the southern portion of the corps zone, that part along the Sélune River. There was little to arrest German movement between St. Hilaire and Barenton, and the enemy was already established in that area. Only two men of the 120th Infantry Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon had returned from an ambush near Romagny, just southwest of Mortain. If Collins recalled the 1st Division from Mayenne to close the St. Hilaire gap, he would create a similar opening at Mayenne. In quest of additional forces to plug the hole, which was inviting the Germans to drive to Ducey and wrest the vital Pontaubault bridgehead from American control, he called upon CCB of the 3d Armored Division (relieved the previous afternoon from attachment to the 4th Division and assembled south of the Sée River in the 30th Division rear). He attached the combat command to the 30th Division and told General Hobbs "to handle the situation S W of Mortain with it."<sup>[33](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn33)</sup> The more immediate necessity of meeting the German main effort north of Mortain and along the south bank of the Sée, however, forced Hobbs to commit CCB in that area.
>
> By chance, an extra unit seemed to materialize out of thin air. The 2d Armored Division (less CCA, which remained near Vire) had departed the XIX Corps sector shortly after midnight, 6 August, leaving St. Sever-Calvados and moving to Villedieu-les-Poëles, then south through St. Pois toward Chérencé-le-Roussel and Mayenne with the intention of supporting or accompanying the 1st Division in an advance toward Alençon. As the leading units of the armored column approached Chérencé on the morning of 7 August, they began to receive artillery fire from across the Sée. The column stopped, but not for long, for General Collins seized upon the troops to plug the hole on the corps right.<sup>[34](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn34)</sup> Meanwhile, the armor had provided temporary stability for the 39th Infantry of the 9th Division at the Sée River.
>
> Backtracking from Chérencé, the armored column moved west several miles to get out of range of the enemy shelling, crossed the Sée, marched to St. Hilaire, and that night took positions near Barenton. So that "one man would be in command of everything at Barenton," General Brooks, the 2d Armored Division commander, assumed control over the troops of the 30th Division and of the 3d Armored Division's CCA, which had unsuccessfully tried to secure the village that day.<sup>[35](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn35)</sup>
>
> Because the 2d Armored Division could not alone close the gap, General

> Bradley gave General Collins the 35th Division, recently released from the V Corps to join the XX Corps of the Third Army in the Fougères-Vitré area. While still under XX Corps control and with some understandable confusion of orders and plans, the 35th Division, having planned to attack south with the Third Army, advanced that evening northeast toward St. Hilaire with the eventual objective the Mortain-Barenton road south of Hill 317.<sup>[36](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn36)</sup>
>
> Thus, less than twenty-four hours after the Germans attacked, the VII Corps had a strength of seven divisions-five infantry and two armored (less one combat command).<sup>[37](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn37)</sup> Still another was alerted for possible shift from the Third Army should the Germans effect a more serious penetration.
>
> Meanwhile, the 30th Division was battling desperately at some disadvantage. Before coming to Mortain, the 30th was to have become part of the V Corps, and plans and reconnaissance had been made toward that end. When the division was abruptly shifted into the VII Corps sector, there was no time for real reconnaissance. With little knowledge of where neighboring units were located and practically no information on enemy dispositions, the 30th hastily took over the positions held by the 1st Division. Shallow foxholes and field artillery emplacements far forward in offensive formation were adequate to accommodate a unit pausing temporarily but were less suitable for defense. Large-scale maps showing the terrain in detail did not become generally available until several days later, and for the most part the lower echelons used crumpled maps that 1st Division men had pulled out of their pockets and off their map boards and passed along before departing. The 30th took over the telephone wire nets left in place and found it so difficult to repair breaks in the unfamiliar system that the division eventually laid its own wire. Although the defensive positions could have been better, the main drawback was that the division had not had sufficient time to become properly oriented. Nor was the division at full strength in meeting the counterattack. Nearly eight hundred replacements, which had joined only a few days before, were hardly assimilated. Two of the nine infantry battalions were absent: one had been dispatched to Barenton on the evening of 6 August, the other had been attached to the 2d Armored Division near Vire. The men of the remaining seven battalions were tired after their march from Tessy to Mortain on 6 August and soon reached a condition "of extreme battle weariness."<sup>[38](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn38)</sup>
>
> General Hobbs at first tended to minimize the importance of what seemed to him to be only a German demonstration. He was concerned somewhat about a possible breakthrough southwest of Mortain to St. Hilaire, but the corps commander, who was making arrangements to block the gap there, directed Hobbs to the more immediate problem in the Juvigny area. Collins ordered Hobbs to

*\--472--*

<a id="page473"></a>

* * *

> furnish four medium tanks to protect the corps wire teams so that telephone lines could remain operative and the corps be kept informed of developments as they occurred. He instructed Hobbs to report hourly on the situation at Juvigny, by radio if other communications were not functioning.
>
> Apparently feeling that Hobbs did not fully appreciate the implications of the attack, Collins told him to take the counterattack seriously. Hobbs protested that he already had committed all his infantry and engineers and was without a reserve, surely indication enough that he was serious. Yet when Collins attached a regiment of the 4th Division to the 30th, Hobbs said he didn't think he needed it, everything was going fine. Surprised, Collins decided to "play it safe" and give Hobbs the regiment "anyway" as an immediate reserve.<sup>[39](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn39)</sup>
>
> By noon of 7 August, intelligence officers estimated that the German forces behind American lines consisted of five battalions of infantry, four of artillery, and two or three of tanks. There seemed no question but that the Germans had "launched a major counterattack to separate First and Third Armies."<sup>[40](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn40)</sup> Stopping the attack depended substantially on the 30th Division.
>
> Hobbs had three main problems: cutting off the penetration northwest of Mortain, blocking the thrust southwest of Mortain toward St. Hilaire, and recapturing Mortain to re-establish contact with the isolated and surrounded battalion. Against the penetration north and northwest of Mortain, Hobbs ordered Col. Truman E. Boudinot's CCB of the 3d Armored Division (attached to the 30th Division) and Col. Edwin M. Sutherland's 119 Infantry to drive northeast and northwest from Reffuveille and Juvigny, respectively, toward le Mesnil-Adelée. He instructed the 117th Infantry to take St. Barthélemy then drive northwest to le Mesnil-Tôve. The two infantry regiments and the combat command, working closely together, established a cohesive front on 7 August and commenced attacking generally north toward the Sée River. To close off the opening that led to St. Hilaire, Hobbs could do little except hope that the 35th Division would arrive quickly. The 120th Infantry launched repeated company attacks in efforts to regain Romagny and cut the roads leading southwest, but the Germans were unwilling to relinquish their positions. Until the 35th Division exerted additional force and drove the Germans from the southwestern outskirts of Mortain, the isolated battalion on Hill 317 would remain encircled.
>
> Meanwhile, the battle raged in the 30th Division sector. The most serious factor was the disorganization and isolation of small units. Communication throughout the division zone was precarious; wires were cut or shot out, and infiltrating German troops and enemy raiding parties menaced messengers and command posts. The 823d Tank Destroyer Battalion destroyed 14 enemy tanks, 2 trucks, a half-track, 3 full-tracked vehicles, 2 motorcycles, a staff car, and a

*\--473--*

> machine gun position before being overrun by enemy infantry and losing 13 wounded, 3 killed, 91 missing, and 11 of its 3-inch guns and prime movers. "There were many heroes today," the battalion commander reported, "both living and dead." One battalion of the 117th Infantry lost 350 men on 7 August, and enemy infiltrators were behind the regimental lines "at several different points." But at the end of the day, even though the troops were "very fatigued, supply problems not solved, defensive sector penetrated," the regimental commander could state: "however key terrain feature still held."<sup>[41](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn41)</sup> The 30th Division lost more than 600 men and much equipment on 7 August, but after the initial shock of the counterattack, the troops held firm.
>
> The situation was similar throughout the corps zone. The 4th Division reacted effectively with artillery fire, destroying during the afternoon of 7 August a German column that tried to move across its front. The division, besides releasing a regiment for attachment to the 30th Division, moved a second regiment to Chérencé in support of the 39th Infantry, which had been split in two by the initial penetration. Despite the precarious situation of the 39th Infantry, Colonel Bond in the early afternoon of 7 August moved those elements that were south of the German thrust around and through the 4th Division sector to rejoin the infantry battalions on the north bank of the Sée. The regimental line at the end of the day was generally the same as on 6 August. A few miles to the northeast, the other two regiments of the 9th Division failed to make contact with the 3gth, but they gained excellent hilltop positions to assure the integrity of the corps left. That evening General Collins attached the 39th Infantry to the 4th Division, which was in contact with the regiment and able to support it.<sup>[42](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn42)</sup>
>
> American artillery had responded to the attack with liberal expenditures of ammunition, operating on the premise that it was better to waste shells than miss a possible target. The weather was excellent throughout the day, and in addition to the artillery observation planes that pinpointed targets, fighter-bombers roamed the area at will, destroying enemy matériel and morale. Ten squadrons of Typhoons of the RAF 2d Tactical Air Force operating from airfields in France flew 294 sorties in the Mortain area. Of seventy enemy tanks estimated to have made the original penetration, only thirty were judged to be in operation at the close of the day. On the morning of 8 August, the estimate was reduced to twenty-five still remaining behind American lines. Prisoners taken by the corps on 7 August numbered 350.<sup>[43](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn24.html#fn43)</sup>
>
> Chance had played an important role in the American reaction. The German decision to make the main effort north of Mortain rather than south of it was vital. The 4th Division was in the right place from which to bring flanking fire

*\--474--*

> on the main effort. CCB of the 3d Armored Division, assembled near Reffuveille, a few miles from the deepest point of the penetration, was able to attack the German spearheads immediately. The accidental appearance of the 2d Armored Division near Chérencé brought comfort to the 39th Infantry, and the fact that the armor was not needed elsewhere and could therefore be inserted into the battle was a happy circumstance. The location of the 35th Division was another lucky break. The capricious factor of weather also was favorable for the Allies. It was fortunate, finally, that officers of good judgment had seen to it that American troops occupied Hill 317, "the key to the whole area."
>
> There was more than chance involved.
>
> The reaction to the counterattack demonstrated a flexibility and a rapidity of reflex that was most clearly illustrated by the fact that British planes operated effectively on the American front.
>
> The forward motion of the Mortain counterattack had come to a halt soon after daylight on 7 August, when the Germans drove their tanks off the roads into the fields and hastily threw camouflage nets over them to escape detection from the ground and air. Although the Germans failed that day to regain the momentum that had enabled them to make a serious penetration of the American lines, they held stubbornly to their forward positions and awaited reinforcement for a renewed thrust toward Avranches. Meanwhile, the battle at Mortain continued.

Source_Link_Capture_Date:With the following specifications:

Completeness:
	- Include all paragraphs in analysis.  It's OK to group multiple paragraphs together as a single sub-event.

Specifications:
	- Prefer Grokipedia sources over Wikipedia
	- Use Wikipedia Sources whe Grokipedia has no entries.
	- Create as many unique entries as there are events and sub-events
	- [ISO 3166 Alpha-2] = ISO 3166 Alpha-2 code
	- When incorporating links to non-'https://www.ibiblio.org/' sites include current date/time of the inclusion.
TOE:
	- Unit(s) 
	- Unit_Nationality
	- Commander_Name
	- Commander_Rank
	- TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Status = Relieved, WIA or KIA:
		  -If the the commander status did not change during the event, ignore the field
		  - TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Date = last day of command
		  - List multiple commanders, if a commander is relieved, wounded or killed.
		  - Attempt to ascertain what the the unit be being discussed is attached to.  For example, a battalion might be attached to a division.  A division to a Corp.
		  - A feature of European Theater is that sub-units might be shifted around.  So they are date sensitive.
		  - Include the commander of higher unit if it can be determined.
		Biographical_reference:
			- Add a link to https://grokipedia.com/ if it exists
		  	- If not add a link to Wikipedia if it exists
	- Equipment Example:
		Name:
			- Sherman
		Identifier:
		- M4
	- Personnel: Was the unit fully staffed?
	- Supply:
		- Were there supply shortages?
Events:
	- Evaluate every paragraph, group paragraphs together as an event.
	- 'Event' is a mandatory field
	- A sub-event is classified as an event that occurs at roughly the same Place/Date and should be treated a unique entry with the same event.
	- Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn] (for example, it should document the absolute paragraph for all paragraphs in the entire $SourceLink and include all text used in analysis.
	- The goal of paragraph number is to be able to easily find the paragraph in the original document.
	- Awards such as Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and Medal of Honor (MoH) should be treated as sub-events:
		- For all awards, attempt to retrieve the original citation
	- Unique Locations are sub-events
	- Unique military units mentioned are to be classified as sub-events
	- A summary of the the sub event should be included.
Place:
	- The GPS coordinates should be are close to the location as possible
	- Map_reference, is applicable when the text indicate a Map image
	Maplink:
		- See: https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/:
		- Roman Numeral identified Maps are at the section:  "Maps I-XLIII are in Inverse Order Inside Back Cover"
		- Maps with regular numbers are at the section:  "MAPS"
	ExternalMapLink: Search for maps directly related to the event/sub-event.
Weather:
	- Every Place name should have a corresponding Weather record
	- Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates example:
		- West: -180.0
		- East: 180.0
		- South: -90.0
		- North: 90.0
	- A Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates should be created using the Place.Place_GPS_coordinate as the center point and going outwards 100 kilometers.
Time and Date:
	- The "Date_group_of_event" is always as published in the text.
	- For date keep a consistent format:
		- DDHHMMZmmmYY, using the Date-time group as specified in: https://web.archive.org/web/20170321080040/http://www.gwg.nga.mil/ntb/baseline/docs/2500a/2500a.pdf
	Assumptions about Dates and Times:
		- All date times in the text are British Double Summer Time (BDST) until 15 Jul 1944
		- From 15 Jul 1944 and forward, assume British Summer Time (BST)
		- 'Zulu_date_group_of_event' is a conversion from BDST and BST to Universal Time
	For imprecise dates and times use:
		- For imprecise dates use: "BEGINNING mmmYY" or "END mmmYY"
		- Imprecise times, use  "APPROX 240900Z mmmYY"
	For "Source_of_date_group_of_event":
		- Default to use of "Source Link: $SourceLink if it exists.
		- Use Grok to search the web for Date.Date_group_of_event if the value is empty.
		- Populate Date.Source_date_group_of_event with the source link that Grok found.
Casualties Specification:
	- KIA = Killed in Action
	- WIA = Wounded in Action
	- PoW = Prisoner of War
	- MIA = Missing in Action
	- If Casualties are unknown, set the value to '0'
Media:
	- External media confirmed to be related to the event
	- Time of media creation should be concurrent to the event
	- If there is a license associated with media, it should be noted
SourceLink: $SourceLink
Footnotes:
	- $Footnotelink
	- Be complete, analyze all footnotes
	- If an event has a footnote, follow that that link and place it into Footnote "Source:" field
	- If the footnote has a link, note the link
	- If a footnote lists multiple documents, each document should be in it's own individual JSON structure.  For example, footnote 1 references two works, the first would be 1a and the second would be 1b.
	- "Footnote" references the modified footnote number, 1a, 1b, etc...
		  - "Footnote_Number" reference the original footnote number.
	- If a footnote source lists a document, attempt to find that document online.   Only include the document is if it quoted in it's entirety or has substantial excerpts.
	- Attach footnotes to the appropriate sub-event and incorporate into the sub-event JSON stanza.
	- Award recipients, should always have an individual footnote.
	- Note that documents attributed to '"NonDigital_Library_Source": "OCMH"' have often been moved to either the National Archive or The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center (USAHEC)
	For non-Digital documents:
		- Find the library
		- The address of the of the library
		- NonDigital_Library_References is the information required to ask the library to retrieve the information
