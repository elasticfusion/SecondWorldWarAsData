> ### *Escape*
>
> Meindl's leadership was without doubt one of the significant actions of the German breakout, perhaps the focal incident. Other commanders and other units had also contributed to the final, though only partially successful, outcome of the operation. Their activities during the twenty-four hours following the arrival of darkness on 19 August were diverse, illustrating clearly the nature and the complexity of the event.
>
> The *353d Division,* under Generalleutnant Paul Mahlmann, had also executed a breakout attack as part of the *II Parachute Corps* effort. Assembled on the evening of 19 August in woods near Vorche, six miles west of the Dives, the division started its movement at nightfall. Meindl had instructed Mahlmann to make his main effort at St. Lambert on the left, while sending his vehicles through Chambois. A little later Mahlmann received information that both localities were in Allied hands. He therefore decided to make his main thrust across the Dives in the Chambois area to try to save his vehicles.
>
> At Tournai-sur-Dives, about halfway to the river, the division came to a halt. The village was burning and its streets were blocked by wrecked vehicles, dead horses, and abandoned tanks. The terrain around Tournai did not permit bypassing the village, so a passage had to be cleared. This took three hours. Though the area lay under harassing artillery fire, the division suffered no losses from it.
>
> Shortly before dawn Mahlmann, in the column on the right, was approaching Chambois. He made contact with a group of tanks, which, according to the officer in charge, had the mission of cleaning the enemy out of the Chambois area. But because this appeared impossible, the tank commander decided to cross the Dives River at Moissy. The tanks moved out around daybreak. Mahlmann and his column, along with stragglers from other units who had joined, followed them closely across the river. The tanks continued through Moissy and disappeared into the distance. Shortly afterward Allied tanks appeared in the vicinity and closed the gap. Their appearance was followed by an intense concentration of Allied artillery fire on the village jammed with German troops. Losses were high, and all semblance of organization vanished.
>
> Mahlmann finally succeeded in bringing some order out of chaos. He organized a breakout attempt with the help of two stray tanks found in the village. The tanks had barely left the village when Allied fire knocked them out. Again, disorganization and apathy set in--spent, dispirited, resigned to their fate, men huddled under whatever cover they could find.
>
> Taking a dozen stouthearted fellows, Mahlmann reconnoitred a concealed road leading to the east, receiving a light head wound in the process. The road enabled Mahlmann to get at least part of the men in Moissy out. Most of the wounded had to be left. All guns and vehicles, except two or three amphibious jeeps, along with part of the division staff, were lost.
>
> Mahlmann headed for the southern eminence of Mt. Ormel, and that afternoon

> he and those who accompanied him began to climb the western slope of the hill. The whole area seemed covered with an amorphous mass of German soldiers hastening toward the ridge. An American observation plane circled leisurely, seeming to hang in the sky, as it directed artillery fire on the retreating troops.
>
> As he approached his objective, Mahlmann faced a situation quite different from that which had confronted the *3d Parachute Division* on his left. German pressure on the northern part of Ormel had forced the Poles to call off their advance to Hill 262 (south) in the morning. Thus Mahlmann was able to occupy his objective without opposition.
>
> There Mahlmann organized three combat groups and deployed them along the ridge line facing west, one composed of SS men on the right, another of men of his own division on the left, and the third of paratroopers in reserve. His efforts to establish contact with units on the flanks and with higher headquarters were unsuccessful.
>
> Late in the afternoon, when the SS group reported hostile reconnaissance units on the north flank, Mahlmann decided to fall back three miles to the east to a new line behind the Vie River. He accomplished his withdrawal without undue interference, and that evening infantrymen and paratroopers occupied the new position. The SS group, disobeying orders, continued to move eastward and vanished.
>
> Soon afterward Mahlmann made personal contact with *Seventh Army* headquarters and received instructions to remain on the Vie until the next day, when his division would be pulled back and sent to the rear for rehabilitation.<sup>[34](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn34)</sup>
>
> Like Meindl's paratroop corps for the north flank, the *XLVII Panzer Corps* had the task of opening the way for the surrounded forces on the southern flank.<sup>[35](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn35)</sup> Funck's *XLVII Panzer Corps* had the *1st SS* and *2d Panzer Divisions* (probably the *10th SS Panzer Division* also) assembled in the Fôret de Gouffern, the *116th Panzer Division* holding a long thin line practically from Argentan to the Dives. The corps was to cross the river in the St. Lambert--Chambois area, with the *116th* covering the rear.
>
> The corps breakout order did not reach the *2d Panzer Division* commander, Generalleutnant Freiherr Heinrich von Luettwitz, until around 1900, 19 August. Because reconnaissance revealed the roads so clogged with wreckage as to make night movement impossible, Luettwitz decided to hold off his attack until 0400, 20 August. He placed all of his tanks (about fifteen) and his armored vehicles at the head of his column, left an infantry regiment reinforced with several antitank guns as a rear guard, and ordered what remained of his artillery to support his advance.
>
> A dense fog hung over the area that morning, and the *2d Panzer Division* was not the only unit moving toward St. Lambert. Columns composed of all sorts of components streamed through the fog, sometimes eight abreast. When the fog lifted, a "hurricane" of Allied artillery fire descended. Vehicles dashed toward the Dives, Luettwitz later remembered,

*\--548--*

> "turned around, circled, got entangled, stopped, and were destroyed. Tall pillars of flame from burning gasoline tanks leaped into the sky, ammunition exploded, and wild horses, some severely wounded, raced" in aimless terror. Effective control was impossible.
>
> Only the armored elements and part of an armored infantry regiment reached St. Lambert in an orderly manner about 1000. Luettwitz led an attack across the river into the village. Incredibly, the bridge across the Dives still stood despite the bombs and shells that had fallen nearby. "The crossing of the Dives bridge," Luettwitz recalled later, "was particularly horrible, the bodies of killed men, dead horses, vehicles, and other equipment having been hurled from the bridge into the river to form there a gruesome tangled mass."
>
> On the east bank of the river, Luettwitz organized and dispatched combat troops for passage through the hail of Allied fire. Wounded that afternoon, he finally departed around 2100, reaching Orville and safety early on 21 August.<sup>[36](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn36)</sup>
>
> Meanwhile the *XLVII Panzer Corps* headquarters and the *1st SS Panzer Division* had probably fought across the Dives River in the St. Lambert-Chambois area early on the morning of 20 August. More than likely they completed their breakout that afternoon.<sup>[37](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn37)</sup>
>
> Covering the *XLVII Panzer Corps* rear, the *116th Panzer Division* had deployed in two groups on the evening of 19 August. One was in the Argentan area, the other north of the Fôret de Gouffern near Bon-Ménil. About 0900, 20 August, the division lost radio communication with the corps headquarters. In the afternoon, when heavy Allied pressure developed against the Argentan group, it pulled back to positions north of the forest.
>
> The pressure was exerted by the 80th Division, which finally took Argentan that day.<sup>[38](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn38)</sup> On the same day British troops approaching from the west moved to the Falaise-Argentan road.
>
> Both groups of the *116th Panzer Division* remained in place during the rest of the day. When the division commander, Col. Gerhard Mueller, learned around 1800 that the corps headquarters was east of the Dives, he prepared to break out during the night at St. Lambert.
>
> Mueller sent a reconnaissance party to St. Lambert after nightfall. Allied artillery fire on the village indicated it was not yet in Allied hands. After strenuous efforts, the troops cleared a narrow passage through the wreckage in the streets. During a two-hour period around midnight, 20 August, the division staff, remnants of the infantry regiment, 5 artillery pieces, and about 50 combat vehicles passed through the village without significant losses. They continued to Coudehard, then to Orville and safety. The Argentan group-about 8 tanks, 10 20-mm. antiaircraft guns, and about 80 Engineer troops--lost its way in the darkness, tried to break out near Trun, and was taken prisoner.<sup>[39](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn39)</sup>

> *Parachute* and *XLVII Panzer Corps* had thus succeeded in large measure. But success did not make it possible for the rest of the troops simply to follow out of the pocket. They too had to fight to get across the Dives River.
>
> The missions of the two remaining corps, the *LXXXIV* and the *LXXIV,* were to cover, respectively, the northern flank and the rear of the breakout operation. Both were then to move across the Dives in the wake of the paratroopers and tankers.
>
> The *LXXXIV Corps* had only remnants of the *12th SS Panzer Division* under its command. Because of the chaotic conditions on the roads and the complete disruption of communications, the division organized its units into two groups for better control. The motorized elements, including what remained of the artillery and the division radio section, were to follow the *1st SS Panzer Division* across the river at Chambois. The rest of the division, mostly infantry, subdivided into task forces for independent action if necessary, was to follow the *3d Parachute Division* through St. Lambert. Four or five tanks or tank destroyers were to cover the rear. General Elfeldt, the corps commander, and Lt. Col. Hubert Meyer, the division commander, accompanied the infantry group.
>
> Around midnight of 19 August, Meyer sent a liaison patrol to the *3d Parachute Division* to obtain word on the outcome of the breakout. The patrol did not return. As all remained quiet along the Dives River, Meyer assumed that the paratroopers' penetration by stealth had succeeded. Therefore, in the very early hours of 20 August, he ordered the infantry group to move out.
>
> At daybreak the group came into contact with several tanks of the *1st SS Panzer Division* preparing to attack through Chambois. The armored infantrymen joined the tanks, but intense Allied artillery, tank, and antitank fire from high ground south of Chambois soon stalled the attack. Because the German armor was drawing the Allied fire, the infantry detached itself and in small groups began to cross the river between Chambois and St. Lambert. Some troops of other units were advancing toward the Allied positions and waving white handkerchiefs and flags.<sup>[40](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn40)</sup>
>
> The two commanders became separated. Elfeldt and his staff took part in an action near St. Lambert with a hastily assembled group of soldiers. Meeting strong opposition and "having literally spent his last cartridge," Elfeldt, the *LXXXIV Corps* commander, surrendered. Meyer, having crossed the Dives, took command of a group of soldiers and led them on foot across the plain toward the southern spur of Mt. Ormel. Using whatever natural concealment was available, they reached safety. Some of the motorized elements of the *12th SS Panzer Division* also escaped that afternoon. Most of the artillery was lost.
>
> The *LXXIV Corps,* designated the covering force in the rear of the breakout attack, had, on 19 August, three of its five infantry divisions *(276th, 277th,* and *326th)* along the northwestern perimeter of the pocket, the other two *(84th* and *363d)* assembled in the Bois de

> Feuillet. The two latter divisions were ready to cross the Dives River in the wake of the *LXXXIV Corps,* the other three were to follow on order.
>
> Communications were practically nonexistent. Orders from corps to division could be transmitted only by staff officers. There was no liaison with the *II Parachute Corps--*General der Infanterie Erich Straube, the *LXXIV Corps* commander, had no knowledge of the time set for the breakout attack. All efforts to establish contact with the *Seventh Army* failed.<sup>[41](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn41)</sup>
>
> The state of affairs in the *LXXIV Corps* sector was therefore somewhat chaotic. The *277th Division* on the corps right was in contact with two corps headquarters, its own and the *LXXXIV,* and for a while received contradictory orders from both. The two divisions farther to the south, the *276th* and *326th,* were out of touch with corps headquarters throughout the day, and both division commanders pondered the problem of whether they should continue to wait for orders or act on their own initiative.
>
> In the early hours of 20 August, after the *12th SS Panzer Division* pulled out of the line on the *277th Division* right, the *277th* fell back to a position along a curved line facing west and northwest-- about one and a half miles from Villedieu-les-Bailleul. There the division remained for the rest of the day. Around 2300, still without orders from the corps, his men exhausted, and short ammunition even for the infantry weapons, the division commander, Colonel Wilhelm Viebig, decided to break out that night. The remnants of the division, about 900 men, moved from their positions to a previously reconnoitred crossing site on the Dives northwest of St. Lambert. The noise of the crossing brought Allied artillery and machine gun fire, and in the ensuing confusion Viebig lost control. Nevertheless, small groups screened by heavy rain continued to move, and what remained of the division reached the *II SS Panzer Corps* lines on the morning of 21 August. A few days later, when Viebig assembled his command--combat units, administrative elements, stragglers, hospital returnees-he had about 2,500 men, of whom approximately 1,000 were combat troops.<sup>[42](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn42)</sup>
>
> Generalleutnant Curt Badinski's *276th Division,* on the *277th* left, received its first order from corps about 0300, 20 August: the division was to fall back, apparently in conjunction with the *277th* withdrawal, to a line just west of Vorche and on the Trun-Occagnes road. Not long after carrying out this move, Badinski received his second and last order from the corps. He was to break out of the pocket south of Trun, starting from his positions at 0830, 20 August.
>
> Soon after his units got under way, it appeared to Badinski that an attempt to break out in broad daylight was bound to fail. Every movement was detected by Allied observation planes and immediately subjected to a heavy concentration of artillery fire. Badinski therefore halted the movement, hoping to renew the attempt after darkness, but before the day was over his command post on the edge of the Fôret de Gouffern was surrounded by Allied tanks, and Badinski and his small staff were taken prisoner. Most of the division

> remnants shared their fate. Only a few men escaped during the stormy night.<sup>[43](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn43)</sup> The *326th Division* received its order to break out during the night of 19 August. The division was to assemble at nightfall, 20 August, near St. Lambert, from there to make its way to Coudehard. Learning that an improvised group of infantry and tanks of the *1st* and *10th SS Panzer Divisions* had crossed successfully at St. Lambert during the afternoon of 20 August, the *326th Division* arranged with elements of the *116th Panzer Division* to make a concerted break that night. The plan worked well. The armor crossed the St. Lambert bridge, miraculously still intact despite the continuous and heavy shelling, and the infantry went over an emergency footbridge nearby. From the river the men marched in a seemingly endless single file column on azimuth toward Coudehard. Despite some inevitable confusion and an occasional burst of fire from Allied outposts, the column reached a road near Coudehard, where the tanks were waiting. Closing behind the tanks, the infantry resumed its advance and, bypassing Coudehard, reached the positions of the *2d SS Panzer Division* at dawn.<sup>[44](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn44)</sup>
>
> The other two divisions under *LXXIV Corps,* the *84th* and *363d,* had been assembled in the Bois de Feuillet ready to follow the *LXXXIV Corps* across the Dives. The *84th Division* commander, Generalleutnant Irwin Menny, was captured; elements of at least one regiment apparently escaped through St. Lambert on 20 August.<sup>[45](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn45)</sup>
>
> The *363d Division* had had its mission changed early on 20 August by what turned out to be its last order from *LXXIV Corps.* Instead of following the *LXXXIV Corps* across the Dives, the *363d* was to occupy and hold a line from Bailleul to Bon-Ménil, north of the Fôret de Gouffern. Generalleutnant Augustus Dettling, the commander, carried out the order but, subjected to heavy Allied pressure during the day, was forced to give up some ground With no instructions from corps, Dettling decided to break out at nightfall. Organized into three kampfgruppen, the division was across the Dives at St. Lambert by 2200, then moved on azimuth toward Coudehard. It sustained considerable losses in killed, wounded, and captured; it lost the bulk of its heavy weapons, all of its artillery, and most of its vehicles. About 2,500 men reached Champosoult and safety the next morning.<sup>[46](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn46)</sup>
>
> The commander of the *LXXIV Corps,* Straube, and part of his staff crossed the Dives during the afternoon of 20 August at St. Lambert, where Straube met Luettwitz, who commanded the *2d Panzer Division.* Together, they worked out measures for holding the crossing site open and organized the men of all arms converging on St. Lambert into kampfgruppen for the completion of the breakout. In the evening Straube departed with one such group of several hundred men and a few tanks. He reached Meindl's command post near Coudehard around midnight, then completed his breakout with the paratroopers.<sup>[47](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn47)</sup>

> While the battle had raged around the Poles on Mt. Ormel, the Polish and American troops in Chambois were also subjected to considerable pressure. Desperate German efforts launched against Chambois on 20 August to open an escape route through the town made the situation so tense that there were moments when Poles and Americans wondered whether they could retain possession of the town.
>
> For the Polish armored group, it was the second day of heavy action without resupply. That evening American supplies came forward, and the Poles received a share of the ammunition, gasoline, and rations.<sup>[48](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn48)</sup>
>
> On that day the 90th Division Artillery was operating with observation later described as an "artilleryman's dream." Five battalions pulverized columns driving toward the Dives. American soldiers cheered when German horses, carts, trucks, Volkswagens, tanks, vehicles, and weapons went flying into the air, disintegrating in flashes of fire and puffs of smoke.<sup>[49](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn49)</sup>
>
> Near Chambois several German tanks and perhaps a company of infantrymen would have escaped but for Sgt. John D. Hawk of the 359th Infantry, who manned a light machine gun. A tank shell disabled Hawk's gun and wounded him, but he secured a bazooka and with a companion kept the tanks in a small wood until two American tank destroyers arrived. Their shelling was ineffective until Hawk climbed to an exposed position to act as a human aiming stake. The subsequent fire of the tank destroyers knocked out two German tanks and forced the remaining Germans into the open to surrender.<sup>[50](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn50)</sup>
>
> The heavy rain that set in around midnight of 20 August helped thousands of Germans to escape to safety. At 0230, 21 August, Meindl began to wake up the men around him near Coudehard. It took some time to get a man on his feet and make him understand what was going on. By 0345, Meindl's troops were assembled along the road in march formation, and the head of the column started to move eastward in the drenching rain. Meindl himself, with two tanks and a small group as the rear guard, departed around 0500. Two hours afterwards, they were within the lines of the *2d SS Panzer Division* near Champosoult.
>
> Later that day Meindl learned that some of his paratroopers had escaped by a route southeast of Coudehard, that a tank unit had brought the seriously wounded *Seventh Army* commander, Hausser, safely out of the pocket, and that he, Meindl, was to move his *II Parachute Corps* to the Seine River south of Rouen. He estimated that between 2,500 and 3,500 paratroopers had escaped; their combat strength did not exceed 600. Of the two regiments of the *353d Division* that broke out at St. Lambert, only remnants of one later rejoined

> Only small isolated groups were able to slip across the Dives during the early morning hours of 21 August. Fighting along the river subsided gradually, and by noon, with all of St. Lambert firmly in Canadian hands, the escape route was closed. Rounding up the remnants of the *Seventh Army* trapped west of the Dives began. Allied troops accepted German surrenders, in mass and in small groups, and gathered up stragglers "who had been living in holes in the ground in the forest since separating from their units." It was not uncommon for an

> Allied division to collect prisoners from as many as twenty divisional units in a single day. "We very much enjoyed going into the woods," a regimental commander later recalled. "One of my lieutenants and I got nineteen \[prisoners\] on one trip."<sup>[51](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn51)</sup>

> Meanwhile, a sizable number of men and vehicles, the tail end of the forces that had succeeded in getting across the Dives during the night, were still moving toward the Mt. Ormel ridge on the

> morning of 21 August. Shortly before noon the Poles on Hill 262 had their hands full repelling German attacks on the southwestern part of their perimeter, that part closest to the Chambois-Vimoutiers road. The culmination came around noon with a suicidal attack of German infantry straight up the hill from the area around the Coudehard church. The massed fires of Polish machine guns smashed it.
>
> Canadian troops advanced and finally made contact with the Polish perimeter that afternoon. Supplies arrived about 1400; evacuation of the wounded and the prisoners began. About that time enemy activity ceased, and what the Poles called the Battle of Maczuga came to an end. Having captured approximately 1,000 Germans, the Poles had lost about 350 men; 11 tanks were damaged or destroyed.<sup>[52](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn52)</sup>
>
> Beyond Mt. Ormel, German soldiers, singly and in groups, had continued to pass through the lines of the *II SS Panzer Corps* throughout the morning of 21 August. The movement thinned out in the afternoon and by 1600 ceased altogether. At dusk the corps moved back its two divisions to an assembly area near Orbec, thirteen miles northeast of Vimoutiers.
>
> *Army Group B* praised the action of the *II SS Panzer Corps* in the highest terms, for it considered the corps had been a major factor making possible the escape of much of the *Seventh Army.<sup>[53](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn53)</sup>* In reality, the corps contribution to the breakout operation, though noteworthy considering its skeleton forces, was not so spectacular as the army group believed. The *II SS Panzer Corps* had accomplished three things: it tied up elements of Canadian and Polish armor on the outer edge of the encircling ring; it helped to open the Coudehard-Champosoult road; and it provided a rallying position for troops that were able to escape the pocket. The major factor deciding the outcome of the breakout operation was the determination and the will to fight of the units inside the pocket.

	- [ISO 3166 Alpha-2] = ISO 3166 Alpha-2 code
	- When incorporating links to non-'https://www.ibiblio.org/' sites include current date/time of the inclusion.
	- All JSON output should be contained in a markdown code box.
TOE:
	- Unit(s) 
	- Unit_Nationality
	- Commander_Name
	- Commander_Rank
	- TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Status = Relieved, WIA or KIA:
		  -If the the commander status did not change during the event, ignore the field
		  - TOE.Commmand Structure.Commander.End_Date = last day of command
		  - List multiple commanders, if a commander is relieved, wounded or killed.
		  - Attempt to ascertain what the the unit be being discussed is attached to.  For example, a battalion might be attached to a division.  A division to a Corp.
		  - A feature of European Theater is that sub-units might be shifted around.  So they are date sensitive.
		  - Include the commander of higher unit if it can be determined.
		Biographical_reference:
			- Add a link to https://grokipedia.com/ if it exists
		  	- If not add a link to Wikipedia if it exists
	- Equipment Example:
		Name:
			- Sherman
		Identifier:
		- M4
	- Personnel: Was the unit fully staffed?
	- Supply:
		- Were there supply shortages?
Events:
	- Evaluate every paragraph, group paragraphs together as an event.
	- 'Event' is a mandatory field
	- A sub-event is classified as an event that occurs at roughly the same Place/Date and should be treated a unique entry with the same event.
	- Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn] (for example, it should document the absolute paragraph for all paragraphs in the entire $SourceLink and include all text used in analysis.
		- In the Sub-event_fulltext.Paragraph_[nn], the brackets are for documentation purposes only and should not be included in the data
	- The goal of paragraph number is to be able to easily find the paragraph in the original document.
	- The goal of '"Footnote_References":' is to relate to to the original footnote.  An original footnote will be exclusively a whole number (1, 2, 3, for example)
	- Awards such as Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) and Medal of Honor (MoH) should be treated as sub-events:
		- For all awards, attempt to retrieve the original citation
	- Unique Locations are sub-events
	- Unique military units mentioned are to be classified as sub-events
	- A summary of the the sub event should be included.
Place:
	- The GPS coordinates should be are close to the location as possible
	- Map_reference, is applicable when the text indicate a Map image
	Maplink:
		- See: https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/:
		- Roman Numeral identified Maps are at the section:  "Maps I-XLIII are in Inverse Order Inside Back Cover"
		- Maps with regular numbers are at the section:  "MAPS"
	ExternalMapLink: Search for maps directly related to the event/sub-event.
Weather:
	- Every Place name should have a corresponding Weather record
	- Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates example:
		- West: -180.0
		- East: 180.0
		- South: -90.0
		- North: 90.0
	- A Spatial Bounding Box Coordinates should be created using the Place.Place_GPS_coordinate as the center point and going outwards 100 kilometers.
Time and Date:
	- The "Date_group_of_event" is always as published in the text.
	- For date keep a consistent format:
		- DDHHMMZmmmYY, using the Date-time group as specified in: https://web.archive.org/web/20170321080040/http://www.gwg.nga.mil/ntb/baseline/docs/2500a/2500a.pdf
	Assumptions about Dates and Times:
		- All date times in the text are British Double Summer Time (BDST) until 15 Jul 1944
		- From 15 Jul 1944 and forward, assume British Summer Time (BST)
		- For German sourced events:
			  - Check the footnote source as to whether the source is a german document or a german post-ware interview
			  - Assume GMT+2, Central European Time (CET)
		- 'Zulu_date_group_of_event' is a conversion from BDST, BST and CET to Universal Time
	For imprecise dates and times use:
		- For imprecise dates use: "BEGINNING mmmYY" or "END mmmYY"
		- Imprecise times, use  "APPROX 240900Z mmmYY"
	For "Source_of_date_group_of_event":
		- Default to use of "Source Link: $SourceLink if it exists.
		- Use Grok to search the web for Date.Date_group_of_event if the value is empty.
		- Populate Date.Source_date_group_of_event with the source link that Grok found.

Casualties Specification:
	- KIA = Killed in Action
	- WIA = Wounded in Action
	- PoW = Prisoner of War
	- MIA = Missing in Action
	- If Casualties are unknown, set the value to '0'
Media:
	- External media confirmed to be related to the event
	- Time of media creation should be concurrent to the event
	- If there is a license associated with media, it should be noted
SourceLink: $SourceLink
Footnotes:
	- $Footnotelink
	- Be complete, analyze all footnotes
	- If an event has a footnote, follow that that link and place it into Footnote "Source:" field
	- If the footnote has a link, note the link
	- If a footnote lists multiple documents, each document should be in it's own individual JSON structure.  For example, footnote 1 references two works, the first would be 1a and the second would be 1b.
	- "Footnote" references the modified footnote number, 1a, 1b, etc...
		  - "Footnote_Number" reference the original footnote number.
	- If a footnote source lists a document, attempt to find that document online.   Only include the document is if it quoted in it's entirety or has substantial excerpts.
	- Attach footnotes to the appropriate sub-event and incorporate into the sub-event JSON stanza.
	- Award recipients, should always have an individual footnote.
	- Note that documents attributed to '"NonDigital_Library_Source": "OCMH"' have often been moved to either the National Archive or The U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center (USAHEC)
	For non-Digital documents:
		- Find the library
		- The address of the of the library
		- NonDigital_Library_References is the information required to ask the library to retrieve the information
