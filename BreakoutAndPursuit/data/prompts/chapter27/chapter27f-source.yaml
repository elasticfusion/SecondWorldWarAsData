> How many Germans escaped? No one knew. At the end of 20 August *Army Group B* reported that "approximately from 40 to 50 percent of the encircled units succeeded in breaking out and joining hands with the II SS Panzer Corps." This was an optimistic assessment. By the end of the following day, the strength of six of seven armored divisions that had escaped the pocket totaled, as reported at that time, no more than 2,000 men, 62 tanks, and 26 artillery pieces.<sup>[54](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn54)</sup>
>
> Later estimates of the total number of Germans escaping varied between 20,000 and 40,000 men, but combat troops formed by far the smaller proportion of these troops. The average combat strength of divisions was no more than a few hundred men, even

> though the over-all strength of some divisions came close to 3,000. The explanation lay in the fact that a partial exodus had begun at least two or three days before the breakout attack--when shortages of ammunition, gasoline, and other supplies had already become acute.<sup>[55](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn55)</sup>
> 
> Some divisions acting on their own initiative, others with the approval of corps, had started to send to the rear, in some instances as far east as the Seine River, all nonessential personnel and vehicles, as well as artillery pieces that could not be supplied with ammunition. Ironically, on 18 August, the day after the *271st Division* ceased to exist as a fighting unit, the division commander, Generalleutnant Paul Danhauser, discovered large stocks of artillery ammunition of all calibers in the Bois de Feuillet, stocks that had been forgotten, overlooked, or simply abandoned. "The shock of this discovery," Danhauser later wrote, "brought tears to the eyes of the commander of the artillery regiment whose batteries had expended their last rounds some days ago."<sup>[56](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn56)</sup>

> The few batteries sent out of the pocket before the final few days were saved. The rest of the artillery, heavy weapons, and other equipment remaining inside the pocket was almost completely lost--destroyed by Allied fire, by the Germans themselves, or abandoned. One commander estimated, probably with some exaggeration, that not many more than 50 artillery pieces and perhaps that many tanks reached safety. Radios, vehicles, trains, supplies were lost; "even the number of rescued machine guns was insignificant."<sup>[57](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn57)</sup> "The losses in material are very high," *Army Group B* reported, ". . . set on fire by enemy fighter-bombers . . . and by

> massed fires of heavy artillery. All radio stations were silenced, and the army was deprived of its means of command. Yet the performance of the men who fought the breakout battle in the face of overwhelming odds merits the highest praise."<sup>[58](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn58)</sup>

> The severe ordeal to which the Germans were subjected for many days-constant air and artillery pounding, exhausting night marches on clogged roads after a day's fighting, shortages of ammunition and supplies--could not be endured indefinitely without affecting troop morale. Many "unpretty pictures" were witnessed by German commanders--incredible disorder on the roads where often the right of the strongest prevailed (tankers and paratroopers being the chief offenders); the panic, men with hands up surrendering in droves; at least one case of outright mutiny when a sergeant shot and killed his commanding officer because the commander refused to consent to surrender.
>
> But the units that were under the firm control of their commanders fought to the limit of their physical and moral endurance and thereby made the escape of a sizable part of the encircled troops possible. One such unit, a paratroop outfit, made quite an impression on men of an SS panzer division when, emerging from the pocket, the paratroopers passed through the tankers smartly, in road formation, singing.<sup>[59](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn59)</sup>

> Behind the men who had fought their way out of the pocket lay an inferno of destruction.

> The carnage wrought during the final days as the artillery of two Allied armies and the massed air forces pounded the ever-shrinking pocket was perhaps the greatest of the war. The roads and fields were littered with thousands of enemy dead and wounded, wrecked and burning vehicles, smashed artillery pieces, carts laden with the loot of France overturned and smoldering, dead horses and cattle swelling in the summer's heat.<sup>[60](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn60)</sup>

> Of the higher staffs, only the *LXXXIV Corps* headquarters was missing. Most of the higher commanders, including Hausser, were wounded. When Hausser was evacuated, Funck, the *XLVII Panzer Corps* commander, took temporary command of the *Seventh Army,* which was subordinated to the *Fifth Panzer Army*.<sup>[61](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn61)</sup>

> The Allies did not know exactly how many prisoners they took. From 13 through 17 August it was possible to count them accurately--British and Canadians reported daily figures in excess of a total of 6,000, the First U.S. Army 2,500 for 15 August alone. After 17 August the figures were approximate-- for example, the First Army estimated more than 9,000 on 21 August.<sup>[62](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn62)</sup> All together, the Americans probably took about 25,000 prisoners, British and Canadians an equal number. Among the captives were three general officers. In addition to the 50,000 men captured,

> As examples of the extent of German losses, the 2d French Armored Division captured 8,800 prisoners and claimed the destruction or capture of more than 100 tanks, over 100 artillery pieces, and 700 vehicles. The 90th Division in four days took over 13,000 prisoners and 1,000 horses; an incomplete inventory of destruction revealed that in addition to 1,800 horses that were dead, 220 tanks, 160 self-propelled artillery pieces, 700 towed artillery pieces, 130 antiaircraft guns, 130 half-track vehicles, 5,000 motor vehicles, and 2,000 wagons had been destroyed or damaged; high-power radio and cryptographic sets, mobile ordnance shops, medical laboratories, and surgical installations had been abandoned.<sup>[64](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn27.html#fn64)</sup>

> An officer who had observed the destruction of the Aisne-Marne, St. Mihiel, and Meuse-Argonne battlefields in World War I and had seen the destruction in London and at St. Lo in World War II, wrote:

> Despite the devastating defeat the Germans had suffered, a surprising number of troops had escaped the pocket. Yet those who had escaped had still to reckon with another crisis--this one at the Seine.
