> ### *The Changing Strategy*
> 
> German strategy in July was rooted in the events of June. When the Allies landed on the Normandy beaches on 6 June 1944, the Germans were without a firmly enunciated policy of defense.<sup>[4](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn4)</sup> The *OB WEST* commander, Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt, and the *Army Group B* commander, Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, were in vague but basic disagreement on how best to meet the expected Allied invasion. Rundstedt tended to favor maintaining a strong strategic reserve centrally located, so that after he determined the main invasion effort he could mass the reserve and destroy the Allies before they could reinforce their beachhead. Sometimes called the concept of mobile defense, this was a normal operational technique. Rommel presupposed Allied air superiority, and he argued that the Germans would be unable to move a centrally located reserve to the battlefield since the Allies would control the air in that area; he believed it necessary to defeat the Allied invaders on the beaches. Sometimes called the concept of static defense, this theory gave impetus to the construction of the Atlantic Wall.<sup>[5](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn5)</sup>

> Hitler never made a final decision on which method of defense he preferred. Consequently, neither method was established as a distinct course of action. By

> inference, it appeared that Hitler favored defense on the beaches since he had charged Rommel with specific responsibility for coastal defense even though the task might logically have belonged to the theater commander, Rundstedt. Although Rommel was subordinate to Rundstedt, he thus had a certain favored status that tended to undermine the chain of command. This was emphasized by the fact that he had direct access to Hitler, a privilege of all field marshals.
> 
> Despite a lack of cohesion in the command structure and an absence of coherence in defensive planning, the three commanders acted in unison when the Allies assaulted the beaches. Rommel gave battle on the coast, Rundstedt began to prepare a counterattack, and Hitler approved the commitment of theater reserves.
> 
> Their actions stemmed from traditional German military thought and training, which stressed the ideal of defeating an enemy by a decisive act rather than by a strategy of gradual and cumulative attrition.<sup>[6](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn6)</sup> As a consequence, the German military leaders, although fighting essentially a defensive battle, searched for a bold counterattack that would destroy the Normandy beachhead and drive the Allies back into the sea. While Rommel fought the tactical battle of the beaches, Rundstedt designated a special headquarters (which he had organized in 1943 to train armored units) to plan and launch a counterattack of decisive proportions. Under the command of the *OB WEST* armor specialist, General der Panzertruppen Leo Freiherr Geyr von Schweppenburg, *Panzer Group West* assumed this function.<sup>[7](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn7)</sup> An Allied bomber struck Geyr's headquarters on 10 June, killed several key members of the staff, and obliterated immediate German hopes of regaining the initiative.
> 
> To take the place of *Panzer Group West,* which could not be reorganized quickly after the bombing, the Germans planned to upgrade the *LXXXIV Corps* headquarters to an intermediate status pending its eventual elevation to an army headquarters. On 12 June, however, its commander, General der Artillerie

> Erich Marcks, was also killed by an Allied bomb.<sup>[8](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn8)</sup>
> 
> By mid-June Rommel was inclined to believe that the Allies had gained a firm foothold in France.<sup>[9](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn9)</sup> Experience in Sicily and Italy seemed to indicate that when Allied assault troops succeeded in digging in on shore, it was very difficult to dislodge them. On 12 June Hitler appeared to accept the validity of the danger, for on that date he recalled an SS panzer corps of two SS armored divisions--about 35,000 men--from the Eastern Front and dispatched them with highest transportation priority to the west. The mission of these units was to take part in the vital counterattack that was to destroy the Allied beachhead.
> 
> While the SS panzer corps and other reinforcements hurried toward Normandy, German troops on the Western Front were sustaining serious losses. Allied air superiority was hampering and delaying the movement of German men and supplies to the battle area, and Allied ground troops were swarming ashore with increasing amounts of equipment. As early as three days after the invasion, officers of the OKH intelligence section and of the OKW operations staff discussed the probable loss of Cherbourg.<sup>[10](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn10)</sup> Five days later, on 14 June, Rundstedt and Rommel agreed to leave only light German forces in defense of the port if the Americans should cut the Cherbourg peninsula and isolate the

> northern portion of it. Thus, only a few troops would be sacrificed in the north while the bulk of the German forces on the peninsula would withdraw and form a defensive line near its base to oppose an expected American attack toward the south. Two days later, on 16 June, as the field commanders, upon learning that the Americans were about to cut the peninsula, prepared to put the withdrawal plan from Cherbourg into effect, OKW transmitted Hitler's refusal to permit them to evacuate the port.<sup>[11](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn11)</sup>
> 
> Although Field Marshals Rundstedt and Rommel considered a strong and costly defense of Cherbourg useless, Hitler was not interested in conserving several thousand soldiers when he could expend them and perhaps keep the Allies

> from gaining a major port, at least until the counterstroke, now planned for 25 June, was launched. While the master counterattack was being prepared to oust the Allies from Normandy, Hitler was unwilling to yield cheaply what he correctly judged to be an important link in the projected chain of Allied logistics.
> 
> Despite Hitler's wishes, the defense of Cherbourg was disappointing.<sup>[12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn12)</sup> German troop confusion, inadequate provisioning of the fortress, and the vigor of the American attack were disheartening to the Germans. The field marshals concentrated their efforts on mounting the still pending major counterattack, even though Hitler continued to recommend counterattacks designed to aid the Cherbourg defenders.<sup>[13](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn13)</sup>
> 
> Conferring with Hitler at Soissons on 17 June, the field commanders agreed to launch through Bayeux what they all hoped would be the decisive counterattack.<sup>[14](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn14)</sup> A reorganized *Panzer Group**West,* under the control of *Army Group B,* was to direct the tactical operation, which would now be launched no earlier than 5 July. The purpose of the attack was to split the Allies on the coast and dispose of each separately.
> 
> As tactical plans for the Bayeux offensive were being readied and troops and supplies assembled, the British launched their attack toward Caen on 25 June.<sup>[15](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn15)</sup> Almost at once the local commander defending Caen judged that he would have to evacuate the city. To retain Caen the *Seventh Army* on 26 June prepared to employ the troops assembling for the Bayeux offensive, not in the planned offensive mission but for defensive reasons, to counterattack the British. Before the commitment of this force, however, the situation eased and became somewhat stable. Nevertheless, German apprehension over the possibility of continued British attacks in the Caen sector did not vanish.
> 
> At this time not only the commanders in the west but also OKW passed from thinking in terms of offensive action to an acceptance of a defensive role.<sup>[16](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn16)</sup> "No matter how undesirable this may be," Rundstedt informed OKW, "it may become necessary to commit all the new forces presently moving up--in an effort to stop and smash . . . the British attack expected to start shortly southeast from

> Caen."<sup>[17](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn17)</sup> So serious had the British threat appeared on 25 June that Rundstedt and Rommel fleetingly considered withdrawing to a line between Avranches and Caen.<sup>[18](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn18)</sup>
> 
> By withdrawing to an Avranches-Caen line the Germans would have good positions from which to hold the Allies in Normandy. Yet such an act might also be interpreted by higher headquarters as the first step in a complete withdrawal from France. Keitel and Jodl had agreed soon after the invasion that if the Germans could not prevent the Allies from breaking out of their beachhead, the war in the west was lost.<sup>[19](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn19)</sup> The point in question was a definition of the term *beachhead.* Would not a withdrawal from the lines already established give the Allies the space and maneuver room to launch a breakout attempt?
> 
> The alternatives facing the German field commanders late in June seemed clear: either the Germans should mount the Bayeux offensive and attempt to destroy the Allied beachhead in a single blow, or they should abandon hope of offensive action and defend aggressively by counterattacking the British near Caen.<sup>[20](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn20)</sup> The British, by acting first, had temporarily nullified the possibility of offensive action, and this seemed to crystallize a growing pessimism among the German commanders in the west.
> 
> Rundstedt had long been convinced that if only a defensive attitude were possible, it would be hopeless to expect ultimate success in the war.<sup>[21](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn21)</sup> Rommel, too, became persuaded that the German chance of victory was slim.<sup>[22](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn22)</sup> More than Rundstedt perhaps, Rommel felt that the Allied naval guns employed as long-range artillery would prevent the Germans from ever regaining the invasion beaches, and significantly he had plotted the first objectives of the Bayeux attack just outside the range of Allied naval gun fire.<sup>[23](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn23)</sup> By 15 June Rommel had admitted that the front would probably have to be "bent out" and Normandy given up because the danger of an Allied attack toward Paris from Caen was worse than a possible threat to Brittany.<sup>[24](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn24)</sup>
> 
> Hitler nevertheless remained firm in his resolve. Even though Rundstedt insisted that the focal point was Caen, Hitler kept thinking in terms of an attack west of the Vire River to save or regain Cherbourg. He cared little whether the reserves gathered near Caen were used for offensive or defensive purposes.
> 
> Tactical developments in the Caen sector bore out the apprehensions of the field marshals. There seemed to be no alternative but to commit additional reserves against the doggedly persistent British. The only troops available were

> those of the *II SS Panzer Corps* withdrawn from the Eastern Front and slated to initiate the Bayeux offensive. The corps jumped off on 29 June in an attack that, if successful, would disrupt the British beachhead, but it was in no sense the contemplated decisive master blow.
> 
> On that day, 29 June, Rundstedt and Rommel were at Berchtesgaden, where they listened as Hitler enunciated his strategy.<sup>[25](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn25)</sup> Acknowledging that Allied air and naval supremacy prevented a large-scale German attack for the moment, Hitler deemed that, until an attack could be launched, the Germans had to prevent the development of mobile warfare because of the greater mobility of the Allied forces and their supremacy in the air. The German ground troops must endeavor to build up a front designed to seal off the beachhead and confine the Allies to Normandy. Tactics were to consist of small unit actions to exhaust the Allies and force them back. In the meantime, the German Air Force and Navy were to disrupt Allied logistics by laying mines and attacking shipping. More antiaircraft protection against Allied strafing and bombing was to permit the German Army to regain a freedom of movement for troops and supplies that would enable the field forces to launch a decisive offensive sometime in the future.
> 
> Thus, the ground troops in Normandy were to assume a defensive role temporarily, while the Air Force and Navytackled the important problems of logistics and mobility. Goering and Doenitz were to hamper Allied logistics and deny the Allies mobility; they were to give the German ground forces a measure of protection for their supply system, thereby assuring them a certain degree of mobility. Until these missions were executed, the ground forces had to hold every inch of ground in a stubborn defense. Unless Hitler could insure for his troops at least temporary protection from Allied planes, offensive maneuvers on a large scale were out of the question. Until he could secure a more favorable balance of supply, he could not launch the decisive action designed to gain a conclusive victory.
> 
> Whether or not Hitler believed that Goering and Doenitz with the obviously inadequate forces at their disposal could give him what he wanted, he proceeded on the assumption that they might.
> 
> When Rundstedt and Rommel returned to the west on 30 June, they learned that the German counterattack north of Caen had bogged down. The brief presence, for once, of German planes over the battlefield, until dispersed by Allied air forces, had been ineffective. The larger situation in Normandy resembled an intolerable impasse. While the Allied build-up proceeded smoothly, the Germans were having great difficulty reinforcing the battlefield; destroyed bridges and railroads and Allied air strafing during daylight hours made this task nearly impossible. With the balance of force in Normandy swinging in favor of the Allies, continued German defense seemed a precarious course of action. Such was the basis on which the field marshals now formally

> recommended a limited withdrawal in the Caen area.<sup>[26](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn26)</sup>
> 
> Hitler refused. To withdraw, even in limited fashion, seemed to him to admit defeat in Normandy, acknowledgment that the Germans had failed against what he estimated to be only one third of the strength that the Allies would eventually be able to put on the Continent. He saw that because there were no prepared defensive lines in the interior of France, no fortified positions that could be occupied by withdrawing troops, defeat in Normandy meant eventual evacuation of France. The only possible place where the Germans could resume a defensive effort would be at the German border, and this made necessary rehabilitating and manning the unoccupied West Wall, the Siegfried Line.
> 
> Hitler had prohibited the erection of fortified lines of defense in France because he believed that their presence would tend to weaken the front by acting as a magnet for weary combat troops and for what he termed "defeatist" commanders. Furthermore, Hitler appreciated that, when troops withdrew, personnel tended to straggle and abandon equipment, actions Germany could ill afford. He was also aware that the Allies, with their superior mobility, would be able to advance more rapidly than the Germans could withdraw. Finally, he underestimated neither the damage to morale a withdrawal would occasion nor the ability to harass that the FFI and a hostile French population possessed.<sup>[27](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn27)</sup>
> 
> On the other hand, the German troops in Normandy occupied excellent and extremely favorable positions for defense. If the Germans contained the Allies and prevented the expansion of the beachhead, they would retain advantageous ground from which Hitler could launch the decisive action that could turn the course of the war. And yet to remain in Normandy and seek the decision there meant the acceptance of the risk of losing the entire committed force. If the Allies broke through the German defenses and developed a war of movement, the result would bring catastrophe to German hopes. Air power and mobility would enable the Allies to institute a blitzkrieg. Unlike that on the Eastern Front, where tremendous space cushioned the effect of breakthrough, mobile warfare on the Western Front was sure to bring the Allies quickly to the border of Germany.<sup>[28](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn28)</sup>
> 
> On the afternoon of 1 July Hitler announced his position unequivocally and declared his willingness to gamble: "Present positions are to be held," he ordered. "Any further enemy breakthrough is to be hindered by determined resistance or by local counterattack. The assembly of forces will continue..."<sup>[29](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn29)</sup> Germans were to take advantage of the terrain, prevent the expansion of the Allied beachhead, and remain as close to the coast as possible.
> 
> This seemed logical to the *OB WEST* operations officer, who felt that a return

*\--27--*

> to the position warfare tactics of World War I was desirable. The Germans needed "to build an insurmountable barrier in front of the enemy along the tactically most advantageous line, from which the enemy numerical and materiel superiority must be beaten down with every conceivable means." If the Germans could fight a war of attrition over a long period of time, using all the guns in their arsenal, antiquated or not, they would perhaps be able some time in the future to launch a counterattack with specially chosen and trained troops to inflict a defeat on the Allied forces on the Continent.<sup>[30](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn30)</sup>
> 
> In complete disagreement, Rundstedt called Keitel, chief of the OKW, and stated that he did not feel up to the increased demands. Whether he meant the increased demands placed on him by higher headquarters or the increased demands of an impossible situation was perhaps a deliberate ambiguity.<sup>[31](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn31)</sup> Reading Rundstedt's message as a request for relief, as an admission of defeat, or simply as an expression of disagreement, Hitler relieved his commander in chief in the west on 2 July. Two days later, Hitler also relieved Geyr, the commander of *Panzer Group West,* who had had the temerity to initiate a report criticizing the "tactical patchwork" in the west--a report endorsed and transmitted up the chain of command to Hitler.<sup>[32](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn32)</sup> Of the field commanders who had metthe Allied invasion three weeks before, only Rommel remained in command, and even he had supposedly asked Hitler at Berchtesgaden how he still expected to win the war.<sup>[33](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn33)</sup>
> 
> Hitler was not impressed with the professional abilities of his senior officers in the west. The Germans had failed in June. The Allies had established a firm beachhead in Normandy. Cherbourg had fallen. A major German counter-offensive had failed to materialize. A fresh armored corps had been committed with no apparent result.
> 
> The Germans had massed troops for a decisive counterattack that did not get started. When the German frame of reference changed from an offensive to a defensive cast, it seemed fortunate to find the bulk of the German strength in Normandy opposite the British. For the Caen sector appeared to lead directly to Paris, and that was where the Germans figured the Allies intended to go.
> 
> As the German ground action became defensive in character, Hitler placed his main reliance on air and naval effort and hoped that Goering and Doenitz would correct the balance of power then unfavorable to the Germans. Until this occurred, the German ground troops were to hold fast and preserve a vital condition--a restricted Allied beachhead--for the offensive action that was eventually to "throw the Anglo-Saxons out of Normandy."<sup>[34](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn34)</sup>
