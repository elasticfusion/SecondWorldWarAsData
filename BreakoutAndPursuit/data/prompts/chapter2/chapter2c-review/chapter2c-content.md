> ### *Tactical Dispositions*
> 
> While the higher commands were preoccupied with offensive planning, the tactical units facing the Allies were occupied with the practical necessity of fighting a defensive war.
> 
> When the Allies landed in France, the German *Seventh Army* controlled Normandy and Brittany from the Orne River to the Loire. Commanded since September 1939 by Generaloberst Friedrich Dollman, who had led it to victory over the French in 1940, the army had its headquarters in comfortable buildings at le Mans. The long peacetime occupation duty had apparently dulled the headquarters' capacities, for even after the invasion it seemed to carry on business as usual. Subordinate commands complained of its bureaucracy in handling supplies, while higher headquarters sometimes felt a lack of personal initiative among its members.<sup>[35](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn35)</sup>
> 
> Doubts as to the efficiency of the *Seventh Army* headquarters had led to discussion of relieving the army of responsibility for the Normandy battlefield and of relegating it to Brittany. The commitment of *Panzer Group West* and the plan to upgrade a corps were attempts to replace the *Seventh Army* command, but because of the destruction of the *Panzer Group West* headquarters and the death of General Marcks, both by Allied bombings, the *Seventh Army* at the end of June still directed combat operations.<sup>[36](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn36)</sup> (*See [Map I.](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-1.jpg%20target=))*
> 
> By then the task had become exceedingly complicated. From one corps in contact with the Allies at the time of the invasion, the subordinate headquarters in contact and under the *Seventh Army* had increased to six. Initially, the *LXXXIV Corps,* commanded by Marcks, had met the Allies. The I *SS Panzer Corps,* under General der Panzertruppen Josef Dietrich, had moved forward from the OKW reserve to assume on 8 June a portion of the front near Caen. Several days later the II *Parachute Corps,* under General der Fallschirmtruppen Eugen Meindl, had traveled from Brittany to the St. Lô sector. On 13 June the *XLVII Panzer Corps,* commanded by General der Panzertruppen Hans Freiherr von Funck, had come forward from the *Army Group B* reserve to the vicinity of Caumont. In midmonth, General der Infanterie Hans von Obstfelder had moved his *LXXX VI Corps* from the Bay of Biscay to take the front between Caen and the Seine River. The II *SS Panzer Corps,* commanded by Generaloberst Paul Hausser, had arrived in the Caen sector near the end of the month after having been recalled from the Eastern Front.<sup>[37](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn37)</sup>
> 
> These seemed too many corps for one army to handle. Consequently, on 28 June the Germans divided the Normandy front into what amounted to two army sectors. On that date *Panzer Group West* took control of the four corps on the right, while *Seventh Army*

> retained control of the two on the left.<sup>[38](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn38)</sup> The boundary lay just west of Caumont and almost corresponded with the boundary that separated the British and American fronts. On 1 July the corps that faced the Allies lined up from east to west in the following order: *LXXXVI,* *I SS Panzer,* *II SS Panzer,* *XLVII Panzer,* *II Parachute,* and *LXXXIV.*
> 
> Each of the two sectors facing the Allies at the beginning of July had about 35,000 combat troops in the line, but there was a great difference in tactical strength because of armament.<sup>[39](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn39)</sup> *Panzer Group West,* opposite the British, had approximately 250 medium and 150 heavy serviceable tanks, the latter including quite a few Tigers and King Tigers.<sup>[40](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn40)</sup> Opposite the Americans the *Seventh Army,* in contrast, had only 50 mediums and 26 heavy Panthers.<sup>[41](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn41)</sup> Of antiaircraft artillery in Normandy, *Panzer Group West* controlled the deadly dual-purpose guns of the *III Flak Corps* and had at least three times the quantity of the other antiaircraft weapons possessed by the *Seventh Army.* It had all three rocket projector brigades available in the west--the *Nebelwerfer,* which fired the "screaming meemies." It also had the preponderance of artillery.<sup>[42](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn42)</sup>
> 
> The imbalance of strength evolved from the nature of the battlefield terrain. In the western sector, where the Americans operated, the hedgerowed lowlands inhibited massed armor action and were ideal for defense. In the eastern sector, facing the British, the terrain was favorable for armored maneuver. Having hoped to launch a major counterattack in June, the Germans had concentrated the bulk of their offensive power there. At the end of the month, when the Germans were passing from an offensive to a defensive concept in Normandy, the presence of Stronger forces on the eastern sector seemed fortuitous to them since Caen blocked the route to Paris.<sup>[43](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn43)</sup>
> 
> Hitler expected the Allies to make the capture of Paris their principal objective. He figured that the British Second Army would carry the main weight of the attack, while the U.S. First Army would protect the open flank. In this belief, he anticipated that the Allies would try to gain control of the middle reaches of the Orne River as a line of departure. From there he expected British forces totaling twenty or twenty-two divisions to strike toward Paris and to seek to meet and defeat the German Army in open battle west of the Seine.<sup>[44](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn44)</sup>
> 
> In order to forestall the anticipated action, the Germans planned to withdraw the armored divisions-all of which were under *Panzer Group West--*from front-line commitment and replace them

> with infantry. On 1 July some 35,000 combat infantrymen were moving toward the front to make this substitution. When the infantrymen eventually supplanted the armor in defensive positions during the month of July, *Army Group B* hoped to have two army sectors nearly equally manned. Nine armored divisions, most relieved by the infantry, would be in immediate reserve.<sup>[45](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn45)</sup>
> 
> To obtain this hoped-for disposition, the Germans had reinforced the battle area in Normandy by virtually depleting by 1 July their reserves in the west. The *First Parachute Army,* under OKL control, was only a small headquarters theoretically performing an infantry training mission in the interior of France and could, in extreme emergency, be counted as a reserve force. OKW controlled only one parachute regiment; *OB WEST* had no units in reserve. *Army Group B* had an armored division and an armored regiment still uncommitted. The *Seventh Army* had not yet committed one SS panzer division and one parachute division. *Panzer Group West* had nothing in reserve.<sup>[46](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn46)</sup>
> 
> To get troops to the battlefield in Normandy, the *Seventh Army* had stripped its forces in Brittany of four divisions and two regiments, and a fifth division was to come forward early in July.<sup>[47](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn47)</sup> The commander of the Netherlands forces had furnished one division. *Army Group G* had contributed from its relatively meager forces in southern France six divisions--four infantry, one panzer grenadier, and one armored--all under orders or marching toward Normandy at the end of June.
> 
> Only the *Fifteenth Army* remained untouched. The few divisions it had sent to Normandy had been replaced by units brought from Norway and Denmark. At the beginning of July the *Fifteenth Army,* deployed between the Seine and the Schelde, still had seven divisions under direct control and directed four subordinate corps that controlled eleven additional divisions.
> 
> The Germans had refused to divert this strong force into Normandy because they expected a second Allied invasion of the Continent in that area. German estimates throughout June had considered an Allied invasion of the Pas-de-Calais--the *Kanalkueste--a* strong possibility.<sup>[48](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn48)</sup> They were convinced that launching sites of a new weapon--the V-1--on the coast of northern France and Belgium constituted a challenge the Allies could not ignore. The Pas-de-Calais was the section of continental Europe nearest to England, and an Allied assault there could be supplied most easily and supported by air without interruption. The fact that this Channel coast area also offered the shortest route to the Rhine and the Ruhr was not ignored.<sup>[49](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn49)</sup>

> The Germans expected an Allied invasion of the Pas-de-Calais because they believed that the Allied divisions still in the United Kingdom belonged to "Army Group Patton." They speculated that the future mission of these troops was an invasion of the Continent in the Pas-de-Calais area, this despite the fact that German intelligence rated the troops as capable of only a diversionary effort.<sup>[50](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn50)</sup>
> 
> "Army Group Patton" was in reality an Allied decoy, a gigantic hoax designed to convince the Germans that OVERLORD was only part of a larger invasion effort. Practiced under the provisions of Operation Fortitude, the Allied deception was effective throughout June and most of July. Naval demonstrations off the Channel coast, false messages intercepted and reported by German intelligence, and other signs of impending coastal assault kept the Germans in a continual state of alert and alarm and immobilized the considerable force of the *Fifteenth Army.*<sup>[51](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn51)</sup>
> 
> That Operation Fortitude was a powerful deterrent to committing the *Fifteenth Army* in Normandy was clearly illustrated by the fact that casualties among troops in contact with the Allies, which mounted alarmingly, were not promptly replaced. By the beginning of July, casualties were outnumbering individual replacements. Yet other factors also accounted for the growing shortage of manpower on the Western Front, among them a complicated replacement system and difficulties of transportation.
> 
> German ground units on the Western Front consisted of a variety of types. The regular Infantry division, with between 10,000 and 12,500 men, had six battalions of infantry organized into either two or three regiments. The specialized static division of about 10,000 men, basically a fortress unit designed to defend specific coastal sectors, had a large proportion of fixed weapons, little organic transportation, no reconnaissance elements, and few engineers. The panzer grenadier division, 14,000 strong, was a motorized unit with one tank battalion and two infantry regiments of three battalions each. The armored division, with 14,000 troops, had two tank battalions; its armored infantrymen were organized into two regiments of two battalions each. The SS panzer division, with 17,000 men, had two tank battalions and two regiments of armored infantry of three battalions each. The Luftwaffe also had ground units because German industry could not manufacture enough planes for the manpower allocated and because Goering had ambitions to have a land army of his own. There were two types of Luftwaffe ground units, both somewhat weaker in fire power than the regular Infantry division. The parachute division had 16,000 paratroopers who were in reality infantrymen; the units accepted only volunteers who received thorough infantry training. The Luftwaffe field division, about 12,500 men, contained miscellaneous surplus personnel from the antiaircraft artillery, from air signal units, from aircraft maintenance crews, from administrative units,

> and a certain number of recruits and foreigners.<sup>[52](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn52)</sup>
> 
> To replace combat losses in the various units in the face of competition between Himmler and Goering for the limited German manpower was no easy task. In late 1942 the Germans had set up training, or reserve, divisions designed to furnish replacements for units in combat. Originally these divisions had had an occupation role, which had not impaired their training function, but later they became garrison troops, and when occupying coastal sectors they were upgraded to field divisions. Thus, instead of existing for the purpose of supplying replacements to the combat forces, they were themselves eventually in need of replacements.<sup>[53](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn53)</sup>
> 
> Although diversity of units, competition between services, and a defective replacement system prevented the Germans from maintaining combat formations at authorized strengths, the difficulties of transportation comprised the most important reason for manpower shortages on the front. By the end of June, when the railroads were badly damaged by Allied air attack and all the Seine River bridges except those at Paris hadbeen destroyed, barges moving on the Seine from Paris to Elbeuf and an eighty-mile overland route for trucks and horse-drawn wagons from Elbeuf to Caen formed perhaps the most dependable line of communications. All highways and other supply routes were overcrowded and in constant danger of Allied air attacks during daylight hours. Units traveling to reinforce the front had to move in several echelons, reload several times en route, and march a good part of the way on foot, mostly at night.
> 
> Transportation difficulties also created supply and equipment shortages. At the beginning of July, the deficit in fuel amounted to over 200,000 gallons per day. Of daily requirements figured at 1,000 tons of ammunition, 1,000 tons of fuel, and 250 tons of rations, only about 400 tons of all classes of supply could be brought to the front.<sup>[54](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn54)</sup> That the quartermaster general of the west had to borrow fifteen machine guns from the military governor of France in order to fill a request from the Cherbourg garrison illustrated into what straits German supply had fallen.<sup>[55](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn55)</sup> For lack of dependable and long-distance railroad routes, armored divisions wore out valuable equipment on the highways before getting to the combat area. The major highways to Normandy were littered with wrecked vehicles. Movement was possible only during darkness, and that at a snail's pace.<sup>[56](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn56)</sup>
> 
> Conspicuous by their absence from the battlefield were the planes of the *Third Air Fleet.* German ground troops grimly joked that Allied aircraft

> were painted silver, while German planes in contrast were colorless and invisible: "In the West they say the planes are in the East, in the East they say they're in the West, and at home they say they're at the front." Of an authorized 500 aircraft in the west, the Germans had about 300 planes, of which only about 90 bombers and 70 fighters could get off the ground at any one time because of shortages of spare parts and fuel. This small number could not challenge the Allied air supremacy.<sup>[57](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn57)</sup>
> 
> By July there was, however, a new weapon in operation that gave the Germans hope of redressing their discouraging situation. Air missiles called the V-1 (originally after *Versuchmuster,* meaning experimental model, later *Vergeltungswaffe,* translated vengeance weapon) and launched for the most part from the Pas-de-Calais area had on 13 June begun to fall on England in a campaign that was to last eighty days. Admittedly a terror agent directed at the civilian population, the V-1s were intended as a reprisal for Allied air attacks on German cities. The campaign reached its greatest intensity during the seven-day period ending 8 July, when a total of 820 missiles were counted approaching the English coast. The Germans soon began to launch some V-1s from medium bombers. Though they were not to appear until early September, the Allies learned in July that V-2 weapons, supersonic rockets deadlier than the V-1s, were almost ready for operational use.
> 
> Allied bombers had since 1943 been attacking V-weapon installations, particularly those diagnosed as ground launching sites. Despite air force protests that the bombardment (Operation CROSSBOW) diverted planes from their primary offensive mission, and despite the fact that air bombardment of the sites was an inadequate defense against the reality of the V-1 attack and the potentiality of the V-2, General Eisenhower on 29 June ordered the air attacks to "continue to receive top priority." Without effective defenses to combat either the V-1 or the V-2, the Allies could only hope that ground forces on the Continent would soon overrun the launching sites. Though the guided missile attacks caused widespread death and destruction in England, they had no effect on Allied tactical or logistical operations. Yet in late June and early July the V-1s and the V-2's were a "threat of the first magnitude" to the Allied command, for "no member of the Allied forces, at any level, knew exactly what the new German weapons might accomplish."<sup>[58](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn58)</sup>

> continued to be an effective cohesive power. Leadership, though often not entirely unified at the higher echelons of command, was excellent at the combat levels. Career and reserve officers and men, as well as conscripted personnel, professed to be uninterested in politics and concerned only with performing their duty. SS officers and noncommissioned leaders were hard-bitten Nazis who were literal minded about their pledge to fight until they died.

> Paratroopers were excellent soldiers. Only the volunteer foreign troops serving with German units were undependable under fire, and they constituted but a small part of the entire German force.
> 
> Despite complaints of impotence due to Allied air superiority, despite a shortage of replacements and supplies, despite the harassing operations of the FFI that slowed the movement of reserves to the battlefield, the Germans in the west had yet to be beaten.
