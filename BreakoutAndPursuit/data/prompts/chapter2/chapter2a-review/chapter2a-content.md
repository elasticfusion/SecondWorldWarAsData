> ## The Enemy
> 
> At the beginning of July 1944, Germany was the target of military operations on four fronts: the Soviet drive in the east, the partisan warfare in the Balkans, the Allied operations in Italy, and the Allied offensive in western France. Only in Scandinavia did German military forces enjoy the quiet of a relatively static situation.
> 
> Of the four fronts, the Balkan battlefield was of minor importance, and the Italian sector, where the Germans fought a delaying action as they fell back, was of secondary significance. The Eastern Front, engaging the preponderance of German resources, was of most concern to the Germans, although the cross-Channel attack had posed a more direct threat to the homeland, and for a brief time--until the Russians launched their summer offensive late in June--the Normandy front was more important. From July on, the Eastern and Western Fronts received nearly equal attention from those directing the German war effort, though far from equal resources.
> 
> Exhausted by almost five years of war, its Navy powerless, its Air Force reduced to impotence, and able to offer serious resistance only on the ground, Germany seemed on the verge of defeat.

> ### *The Machinery of War*
> 
> Adolf Hitler was directing the war. In addition to the responsibility and the nominal command borne by all heads of states, Hitler exercised a direct control over military operations. He determined the military strategy on all fronts and supervised closely the formulation of plans and their execution. Increasingly, as the struggle continued, he controlled the tactical operations of the troops. This close control of the military was perhaps inevitable. The pyramidal hierarchy of command reached its ultimate in him.
> 
> With an active and bold imagination, and often displaying an astute grasp of military matters, Hitler could coordinate his military objectives and his political goals far better than anyone else in Germany. Though by 1944 Hitler had delegated to others many of his governmental functions, he felt that he could not afford to do so in the military realm. The urgency of the life and death struggle with the Allies, he was convinced, compelled him to give his personal attention even to relatively minor problems, and his self-assumed commitments overworked him.

> the Supreme Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces--the *Oberster Befehlshaber der Deutschen Wehrmacht.* His staff was the Armed Forces High Command, the *Oberkommando der Wehrmacht.* (OKW), headed by Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel. Theoretically, OKW was the highest military echelon under Hitler, and to it belonged the prerogatives of grand strategy and joint operations. On a lower echelon, Reichsmarschall Hermann Goering headed the Air Force High Command, the *Oberkommando der Luftwaffe* (OKL); Grossadmiral Karl Doenitz headed the Navy High Command, the *Oberkommando der Kriegsmarine* (OKM); while Hitler himself headed the Army High Command, the *Oberkommando des Heeres* (OKH).
> 
> In theory, the chief of the OKW, Keitel, received the reports and co-ordinated the activities of the OKL, OKM, and OKH. But Goering outranked Keitel and therefore reported directly to Hitler. Doenitz felt that Keitel had little interest in and understanding of naval matters, and he also reported directly to Hitler. Since Hitler himself was chief of the OKH, there seemed to be no practical need for the OKW. Yet because the war against the Soviet Union required all the attention of the OKH, the OKW assumed the direction of the other theaters.<sup>[2](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn2)</sup> OKW and OKH were thus reduced to agencies directing the ground campaigns and, together with OKL and OKM, were directly subordinate to and dominated by Hitler, the Supreme Commander in Chief.
> 
> Although the chain of command was unified at the top in the person of Hitler and although spheres of activity seemed clearly defined among the high commands, staff functions in actual practice were often confused. OKW, for example, had no intelligence section or logistical apparatus. For information about the enemy and for administration, including replacements, it relied on the OKH. OKL organized and controlled antiaircraft artillery units, Luftwaffe field divisions, and paratroopers, which in American doctrine were ground force

> units. Competition over such matters as replacements caused friction among the services. Goering exploited his political power, while Reichsfuehrer Heinrich Himmler complicated the command structure because he headed the *Schutzstaffel* (SS), an elite corps of infantry and armored units.<sup>[3](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn2.html#fn3)</sup>
> 
> Similar inconsistencies appeared in the field. Commanders exercised control over assigned troops but not over strictly defined geographical areas. Except in designated fortress cities, the three military services were independent branches, expected to co-operate but not functionally organized to insure complete co-ordination of effort. The result, perhaps not so surprisingly, redounded to Hitler's personal advantage.
> 
> In western Europe, *Navy Group West* was the field command of the OKM, and the *Third Air Fleet* was the field command under OKL. The ground force field command under the OKW was *Oberbefehlshaber West (OB WEST),* and within the limits of the German command system it functioned as the theater headquarters. Unlike General Eisenhower, who in comparison had virtual carte blanche for the conduct of the war, the German theater commander operated under the close personal supervision of Hitler, who directly or through the Operations Staff of OKW, the *Wehrmachtfuehrungsstab (WFSt),* a planning section directed by Generaloberst Alfred Jodl, did not hesitate to

> The theater commander did not control the naval and air force contingents in his sector. France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, though under the nominal control of *OB WEST,* each had a military governor who exercised responsibility for internal security of the occupied territory; yet for tactical action against an invading enemy, *OB WEST* had operational control over the troops assigned to the military governors. OKW maintained direct contact with each military governor and supervised *OB WEST* supply and administration.

The boundary between the army groups was an east--west line across France from the Loire River to the Swiss border near Lake Geneva, although there was always a lack of clarity as to whether *OB WEST* or the military governor exercised authority over tactical troops in central France. *([Map 2](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-2.jpg))*

> South of the boundary was the sector of *Army Group G,* a headquarters that controlled the *First Army,* which defended the Atlantic coast of France south of the Loire, and *Nineteenth Army,* which held the Mediterranean shores of France. The *Replacement Army,* which trained units in the interior of France, furnished troops for security duties against the FFI and was ready to undertake operations against airborne landings.
> 
> North of the Loire-Geneva boundary line was *Army Group B.* Under this headquarters, *LXXXVIII Corps* occupied the Netherlands, *Fifteenth Army* defended the coast of Belgium and of northern France to the Seine River, and *Seventh Army* had responsibility for that part of northwest France between the Seine and the Loire Rivers.
> 
> The chain of command, then, that had functioned to meet the Allied invasion of western Europe consisted of Hitler; the OKW, which transmitted Hitler's orders; *OB WEST,*the ground force headquarters in the west that operated as the theater command; *Army Group B,* which had tactical control of the troops along the Channel coast; and *Seventh Army,* which had found itself responsible for the area invaded.
