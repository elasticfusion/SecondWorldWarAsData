      "Sub-event_summary": "Field Marshal von Rundstedt, OB WEST commander, expressed pessimism about holding Normandy, suggesting a withdrawal. Hitler replaced him with Field Marshal von Kluge on 2 July, who initially criticized Rundstedt but soon shared his views after visiting the front.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_1": "In the German command structure, the commander of OB WEST was in the best position to perceive the true state of affairs in Normandy. Field Marshal von Rundstedt had long felt that the Germans could not win a war of attrition in a confined beachhead area.¹ On 1 July he telephoned OKW and told Keitel that the only course of action possible was to make peace. Keitel asked Rundstedt what to say to Hitler. \"Make peace, you fools,\" Rundstedt replied. \"What else can you do?\"²",
        "Paragraph_2": "On the following day, 2 July, Hitler replaced Rundstedt with Generalfeldmarschall Guenther von Kluge.³ Kluge, who had commanded an army group on the Eastern Front, had recently recovered from an automobile accident. He had spent several weeks at Berchtesgaden in close association with Hitler, and he came to the west with optimism and confidence, convinced that Rundstedt's pessimism was unjustified. Before assuming command, Kluge talked with Rommel, who agreed with Rundstedt that the situation was critical but who, unlike Rundstedt, was determined to fight to the last.⁴ Kluge also talked with Keitel and Jodl, who advised him to study the situation before making judgments. Kluge's first act as commander of OB WEST was to criticize Rundstedt's conduct of operations. After visiting the front, however, Kluge changed his mind. \"I have arrived here full of enthusiasm,\" he wrote to Hitler on 5 July, \"and I must admit the sight of the Atlantic Wall and the forces behind it gave me a feeling of oppression. . . . [The enemy] has complete mastery of the air. . . . It is a wonder that our troops are fighting as they are. . . . The enemy artillery is laying down a terrific barrage. . . .

Famous for his campaigns in Africa and Italy, Rommel was energetic and inspiring. He was respected by the troops and popular with the German public. He had been in Hitler's favor since the Polish campaign of 1939, and his special status in the command structure of the west--his responsibility for coastal defense and his direct access to Hitler--sometimes enabled him to bypass Rundstedt. When Kluge replaced Rundstedt, Rommel was momentarily apprehensive that Kluge's presence would impair his freedom of action. But Kluge soon assured him that he had no intention of directing operations from the rear but rather would exercise his influence at OKW to obtain for Rommel the men and matériel needed to wage the battle.⁶"
