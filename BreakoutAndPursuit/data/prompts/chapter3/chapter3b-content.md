> ### *German*
> 
> At the beginning of July the Germans in the west were in the midst of important command changes. Generalfeldmarschall Guenther von Kluge, who had commanded an army group on the Eastern Front for two and a half years, was arriving to replace Rundstedt as commander in chief in the west. General der Panzertruppen Heinrich Eberbach, formerly a corps commander on the Eastern Front and an outstanding armor officer, was about to relieve Geyr as commander of *Panzer Group West*. Hausser, formerly commander of the *II SS Panzer Corps* had recently become commander of the *Seventh Army*, taking the place of Dollman, who had died of a heart attack. Of the high-ranking officers who had met the Allied invasion less than a month earlier, Rommel, commander of *Army Group B*, remained as the single veteran with experience against the British and Americans.

> Deeply impressed by the Allied success and the German failure in June, Rommel felt that errors in tactical deployment and in handling reserves had contributed to a large extent to the situation at the beginning of July.<sup>[34](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn3.html#fn34)</sup> He also believed that *OB WEST's* lack of certain command prerogatives had been detrimental to the German effort; he recommended that *OB WEST* be given command over all the elements in the theater, including Navy and Air, "like Montgomery's" headquarters.<sup>[35](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn3.html#fn35)</sup>

> Aware of Rommel's capacity for enthusiasm and despair, Hitler had alerted Kluge to the possibility that Rommel might be a difficult subordinate. But when Kluge visited Rommel soon after his arrival in the west, he found that they were agreed on the course of action

> to be followed: "Unconditional holding of the present defense line. . . . Improvement of the present lines forward, i.e. by attack after most careful preparation where it appears profitable. Fortification of the sector behind the front by all means available."<sup>[36](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn3.html#fn36)</sup>
> 
> The two sectors of the army group front were dissimilar. Eberbach, who had the mission of keeping Montgomery from getting across the Caen plain toward Paris, deepened the defense of *Panzer Group West*. He feared that if his troops occupied a shallow line of resistance in dense concentrations they would be destroyed by British artillery. He therefore planned to keep one third of his infantry on a lightly held outpost line and on his main line of resistance. The remainder of the infantry was to hold successive positions behind the main line to a depth of about 2,000 yards. Rear echelon troops and reserves were to construct alternate positions from 1,000 to 6,000 yards behind the front. These defenses, plus interlocking firing positions backed up by the antiaircraft artillery of the *III Flak Corps* in a ground role, were to prevent British armor from making a breakthrough. Behind the static defense positions, emergency reserves consisting of tank-infantry teams were to be ready to move to threatened points of penetration. Finally, if the British nevertheless broke through the defenses, panzer divisions in operational reserve were to be prepared to seal off the openings.
> 
> This was deep-zone defense and effective utilization of resources for a defensive mission. During July, Eberbach was to attempt with partial success to replace his armor on the front with infantry units arriving to reinforce the sector.<sup>[37](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn3.html#fn37)</sup>
> 
> Hausser, in command of the *Seventh Army*, with fewer troops but better defensive terrain than Eberbach, organized what in comparison appeared to be a shallow defense. Behind the outpost line and the main line of resistance, both sparsely manned in order to bolster the reserves, the bulk of the troops were grouped into local reserves capable of launching counterattacks with the support of tanks and assault guns. Although Hausser's *Seventh Army* lacked the fire power of Eberbach's *Panzer Group West*, it had plenty of assault guns. Superior to tanks in fire power, they were effective weapons that Americans habitually mistook for tanks.
> 
> In the *Seventh Army* sector the Germans expected a type of combat they called "bush warfare." Battle in the hedgerows was to be fought according to the pattern of active defense. Anticipating that the Americans would advance in small parallel tank-infantry columns, the Germans planned to meet them by having a reserve commander lead his small unit in a counterattack against the American flank--if he could find it. "We cannot do better," the Germans reported, exactly as their American adversaries often stated, "than

> to adopt the methods of combat of the enemy with all his ruses and tricks."<sup>[38](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn3.html#fn38)</sup>
> 
> Because of the planning for offensive action in June, the bulk of German strength was still concentrated in the Caen sector under *Panzer Group West*. In comparison, the *Seventh Army*, with a defensive mission of preventing the Americans from driving south, was expecting the imminent arrival of a single armored division. The army had three relatively fresh infantry-type divisions four composite units of battered troops that were divisions in name alone, one detached parachute regiment, and three kampfgruppen. Of two sorts, kampfgruppen were mobile combat teams of regimental size formed from static of infantry divisions with organic or requisitioned transport to meet the crisis of the invasion, or they were improvised field formations used to organize remnants of combat units. The kampfgruppen in the *Seventh Army* sector at the beginning of July were of the first type; during July many were to become the second sort.
> 
> The *Seventh Army* had two corps, the *II Parachute* and the *LXXXIV*. The *II Parachute Corps*, which had moved from Brittany in mid-June, held a sixteen-mile sector between the Vire and the Drome Rivers. Responsible for the St. Lô-Caumont area, the corps controlled two divisions and two kampfgruppen.
> 
> On the extreme left (west) of the German positions in Normandy, the *LXXXIV Corps* faced the Americans in the Cotentin. The initial corps commander, Marcks, had been killed early in June, and OKW had appointed Generalleutnant Dietrich von Choltitz to take his place. While Choltitz was traveling from the Italian front to take up his new post, General der Artillerie Wilhelm Fahrmbacher had temporarily left his corps command in Brittany to lead the *LXXXIV Corps* in the Cotentin. Choltitz assumed command on 18 June, and Fahrmbacher returned to Brittany.
> 
> Responsible for the area west of the Vire River to the Cotentin west coast, Choltitz in reality had two sectors separated by the Prairies Marécageuses de Gorges. A panzer grenadier division, reinforced by an infantry kampfgruppe and a separate parachute regiment, defended on the right (east). On the left, elements of five infantry divisions were deployed in an outpost position and on a main line of resistance. Desiring a deeper defense, Choltitz had on his own initiative delineated additional lines of defense in the rear, lines he had not divulged to higher headquarters for fear of appearing to controvert Hitler's instructions to hold fast. In the center and to the rear, a parachute regiment, under OKW control, constituted the corps reserve.
> 
> The strength of the German defenses in the Cotentin stemmed not so much from the quality or the number of the troops as from the nature of the terrain occupied. The soldiers of the static coastal divisions that had met the initial onslaught of the Allied invasion were older personnel, many of limited duty, equipped for the most part with a variety of weapons that were not the most modern. These units, as well as others that had arrived later, had sustained very heavy losses during the June fighting.

> Yet the ground they held in the Cotentin was so favorable for defense that the Germans could look forward with confidence to the forthcoming American attack.
> 
> American preoccupation with Cherbourg in June and the German decision to contest not that main effort but the anticipated drive to the south had resulted in a two-week respite in the Cotentin that the Germans had used to advantage. They had fashioned a coherent defense.<sup>[39](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn3.html#fn39)</sup>
> 
> Despite excellent defensive preparations--Eberbach facing the British with a deep-zone defense, Hausser facing the Americans and utilizing the terrain to advantage--holding the line in Normandy was a gamble. As Rundstedt and Rommel had pointed out, if the Allies succeeded in penetrating the German positions, the absence of defensive lines between Normandy and the German border meant that the Germans would have to withdraw from France. Lacking mobility comparable to that of the Allies meant that the withdrawal would probably turn into retreat and rout. Yet the fact was that the German troops held the best positions they could hope for in France. The line was relatively short; the terrain was naturally strong; the battlefield imposed serious restrictions on Allied deployment. Only a small sector of open ground near Caen was difficult to defend. With reserves on the way, the Germans could reasonably hope to hold out until the decisive counterattack or the miracle promised by Hitler turned the course of the war.
