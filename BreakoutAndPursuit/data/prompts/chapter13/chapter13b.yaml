> ### *Penetration*
>
> On the morning of 26 July, the situation from the American point of view did not appear very bright. On the right of VII Corps, the 330th Infantry, which was to safeguard the flank of the COBRA main effort by cutting the Périers-St. Lô highway, securing a road intersection, and turning gradually westward, was hopeful of accomplishing its missions early on 26 July, for the tank destroyer fire that had been harassing the regiment from Marchésieux ceased.<sup>[6](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn6)</sup> But it soon became evident that the German paratroopers in opposition were as determined as ever. Not until late in the evening was the 330th Infantry able to cross the Périers-St. Lô highway, and even then the Germans continued to deny the regiment its crossroads objective.<sup>[7](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn7)</sup>
>
> Instructed to permit the principal COBRA armored column to pass through his 9th Division zone, General Eddy on 26 July had to clear both enemy troops and his own from the Marigny road.
>
> He had to prevent the enemy from cutting the road and thereby blunting the main COBRA thrust. Restricted to a narrow zone of operations and facing German forces unharmed by the COBRA bombardment, General Eddy maneuvered his units so that the 9th Division by the end of the day was two and a half miles south of the Périers-St. Lô highway and almost two miles west of the Marigny road. The division had sustained almost 200 casualties and had captured somewhat fewer prisoners. Although General Eddy had prevented his own troops from hampering an armored column moving south and had kept the Marigny road clear of enemy fire to the extent of his penetration, he faced the opposition of the *353d Division,* which, in trying to retake la Chapelle-en-Juger, threatened the VII Corps right flank.<sup>[8](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn8)</sup>
>
> The 8th Infantry of the 4th Division took la Chapelle-en-Juger in the early morning of 26 July. Combat patrols had entered the village during the night, but the village crossroads was not secured until morning.<sup>[9](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn9)</sup> Continuing south, the regiment moved slowly, clearing isolated enemy groups. Commitment of the reserve battalion in the afternoon provided enough added weight for a three-mile surge that overran part of the *353d Division* and put *Panzer Lehr* artillery units to flight. Early that evening the leading troops engaged what seemed like the remnants of a German battalion, captured about a company of miscellaneous

> troops, and destroyed or dispersed the others. The regiment cut the Coutances--St. Lô highway and at the end of the day was about five miles south of the COBRA line of departure.<sup>[10](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn10)</sup> On the corps left, the 30th Division had not only to protect the COBRA flank but also to permit an American armored column to pass through the division zone for exploitation beyond St. Gilles. Enemy artillery fire from what was estimated to be one medium and three light battalions, as well as from several 88-mm. guns, checked any real advance during the morning of 26 July; but counterbattery missions delivered by the artillery units of the 30th Division, the VII Corps, and the XIX Corps produced the desired effect early that afternoon. As the division began to advance against diminishing artillery and mortar fire, an armored column passed through the division zone and drove toward St. Gilles.<sup>[11](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn11)</sup>
>
> The 117th Infantry, attacking toward the loop of the Vire River, was stopped at a steep ravine where a well-positioned line held by part of the *352d Division* was supported by *II Parachute Corps* artillery firing from the high ground south of St. Lô. The regiment made five different attempts to overcome the resistance, but without success. Though close support by fighter-bombers might have aided the attack, General Hobbs was reluctant to request it because he feared a repetition of bombing errors. Accepting the apprehension as valid, General Collins did not press for the employment of tactical air. Not until evening, after a heavy 4.2-inch mortar preparation that coincided with a German withdrawal, did the regiment cross the ravine and move quickly to the entrance of the loop, less than two miles west of St. Lô.<sup>[12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn12)</sup>
>
> The 119th Infantry, the other assault regiment, moved rapidly in the afternoon for two miles south of Hébécrevon and cut the Coutances-St. Lô highway. Given a new mission at once--cutting the Canisy-St. Lô highway two miles to the south--the regiment was half way to its objective by nightfall. At this point the leading troops of the 30th Division were more than three miles south of the pre-COBRA positions.
>
> By late afternoon of 26 July, General Collins no longer doubted that his forces had achieved a clear penetration of the enemy defenses. Deeming that the situation demanded speed rather than caution, he told the infantry divisions to continue their attacks through the night.<sup>[13](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn13)</sup>
>
> General Collins' directive coincided with a German order to make a slight withdrawal. During the night of 26 July the German units west of the Taute River--those comprising the left of the *LXXXIV Corps*\--withdrew slightly along the coast and took up a new line of defense anchored on Périers and Marchésieux. The *6th Parachute Regiment* passed into the corps reserve at St. Sauveur-Lendelin. Just to the right of the corps boundary, the 352d *Division* of the *II Parachute Corps,* already outflanked,

> also withdrew from the loop of the Vire and along the west bank of the Vire River--in order to try to re-establish contact with *Panzer Lehr*.<sup>[14](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn14)</sup> This could be no more than a hope, for by that time there was virtually no organized resistance between the *352d,* and the *5th Parachute Divisions,* though the German higher commands did not seem to know it.
>
> Although the 330th Infantry on the extreme right flank of the VII Corps again struck stonewall resistance, all the other infantry units advanced during the night of 26 July. The 9th Division secured a road junction of local importance. The 8th Infantry of the 4th Division, leaving its vehicles and antitank guns behind, moved unencumbered for several miles, outflanked both the *Panzer Lehr* artillery and the remaining reserves of the regiment of the *275th Division* at Marigny, and, at dawn, hastened the flight of a withdrawing enemy column. Some troops of the 30th Division moved easily into the loop of the Vire River while others cut the Canisy--St. Lô road.
>
> Except on the extreme right flank of the VII Corps where the 330th Infantry was denied for the third day the crossroads on the Périers-St. Lô highway that constituted its original objective, developments after daylight on 27 July indicated that the infantry was nearing fulfillment of its COBRA aims. The 9th Division, in a regimental attack against some 200 Germans, who were on a small ridge and were supported by four tanks and several antitank guns, destroyed the bulk of this force and dispersed the remainder.<sup>[15](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn15)</sup> The 4th Division sent its reconnaissance troop ahead to screen a rapid advance.<sup>[16](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn16)</sup> Strong resistance from enemy positions hastily erected during the night melted away. The 8th Infantry cut the Carantilly-Canisy road and proceeded to a point more than seven miles south of the Périers-St. Lô highway. To clear small pockets of bypassed Germans, General Barton committed portions of the 12th Infantry, which had been in division reserve since the commencement of COBRA. Contingents of the 30th Division moved all the way into the loop of the Vire River and established physical contact with the 35th Division at the St. Lô bridge. Other units secured the two Vire River bridges on the main roads south of St. Lô. General Hobbs committed his reserve regiment, the 120th, which drove south along the Vire River for almost six miles against little opposition.
>
> "This thing has busted wide open," General Hobbs exulted. He was right. Evidence of German disintegration was plentiful. Some German soldiers were walking into command posts to surrender; other were fleeing south or across the Vire River.<sup>[17](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn17)</sup>
>
> On the morning of 28 July, the 330th Infantry at last was able to move against virtually no resistance to rejoin its parent unit, the 83d Division. In the 9th Division sector, only an occasional round

> of artillery or mortar fire was falling by noon; small arms fire had ceased. Having fulfilled its COBRA assignment, the 9th Division passed into reserve for rest and reconstitution. The 4th Division mopped up isolated enemy remnants and prepared to move south in a new operation. The 30th Division, advancing south along the west bank of the Vire River, passed from control of the VII Corps.
>
> For the infantry units that had run interference, Operation COBRA had ended. General Hobbs perhaps typified infantry sentiment when he stated, "We may be the spearhead that broke the camel's back."<sup>[18](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn13.html#fn18)</sup> There was no doubt that the camel's back was broken and that the infantry had helped break it. But the armored forces of Operation COBRA also played their part.
