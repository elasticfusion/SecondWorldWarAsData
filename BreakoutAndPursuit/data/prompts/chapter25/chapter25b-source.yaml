> ### *he German Dilemma*
>
> The aerial bombardment on the night of 7 August and the estimate that six hundred Canadian tanks were attacking toward Falaise alarmed the German command in Normandy:
>
> "We didn't expect this to come so soon," Kluge told Eberbach, "but I can imagine that it was no surprise to you."
>
> "No," Eberbach said, "I have always awaited it and looked toward the morrow with a heavy heart."[9](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn9)
>
> The moment was particularly dark because Kluge, in compliance with Hitler's order for a second and stronger attack toward Avranches, had started to move three armored divisions out of the *Fifth Panzer Army* sector toward the Mortain area. The *10th SS Panzer Division* was already on the move, but orders for the *9th SS* and *12th SS Panzer Divisions* were canceled. The latter remained south of Caen to help stop the Canadians. Units of the newly arriving *85th Division,* instead of being assembled at Tinchebray for eventual commitment near Brécey, were diverted immediately to the Falaise sector. The Panther tank battalion of the 9*th Panzer Division* and a rocket brigade, also scheduled to participate in the attack toward Avranches, joined the defenses north of Falaise.[10](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn10)
>
> The second attack toward Avranches was scheduled for the evening of 9 August but, on the basis of the Canadian threat, Kluge that afternoon postponed it. Developments on the American front contributed to Kluge's decision. Attacks on 8 August by the V and XIX Corps between Vire and Sourdeval had strained the *II Parachute* and *LXXXIV Corps* and had ripped the *363d Division* to such an extent that the *Seventh Army* was trying to accelerate the arrival of the *331st Division* into the line. Perhaps worse, U.S. pressure had compelled the *XLVII Panzer Corps* during the night of 8 August to pull back slightly the *2d Panzer Division's* most advanced wedge of the counterattack forces near le Mesnil-Tôve and Chérencé. Even more threatening was the attack of the 2d Armored Division against the deep southern flank of the *2d SS Panzer Division* at Barenton. Finally, the capture of le Mans and the possibility of an American attack northward to Alençon tied down the *LXXXI Corps* and prevented the *9th Panzer Division* from

> adding its strength to the second attempt to gain Avranches.[11](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn11)
>
> The second effort was to have been made over the same terrain as the first, but this time with two corps moving abreast: the *XLVII Panzer Corps* (with four armored divisions--*1st SS, 2d SS, 2d,* and *116th)* and the *LVIII Panzer Corps* (with the *9th SS and 10th SS Panzer Divisions,* as well as the Panther tank battalion of the *9th Panzer Division).* The attacking corps were to have been supported by two rocket brigades and reinforced later by the *12th SS Panzer* and *85th Infantry Divisions*.[12](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn12) Continued Allied pressure and the threats to the flanks made it necessary to divert an increasing number of elements designated for the attack to defensive missions. The *116th, 2d SS,* and remnants of *Panzer Lehr* moved to the *LXXXIV Corps* to support the *363d* and 353d *Divisions* between Vire and Sourdeval; the *LVIII Corps* (with the *10th SS Panzer Division)* was inserted at Barenton to relieve the weak *275th Division* (which moved to the *Fifteenth Army* area for reconstitution) and protect the long *2d SS Panzer Division* flank. The emphasis turned unmistakably to defense.
>
> Despite postponement of the second attempt to drive toward Avranches and despite the fact that the *XLVII Panzer Corps,* basically the striking force, retained control over the *1st SS* and *2d Panzer Divisions,* the German commanders in Normandy felt that a renewed effort might still succeed if certain conditions were met: if the positions north of Falaise remained stable, if a strong defense could be established north of Alençon to protect the ammunition and gasoline dumps nearby, if the Panther battalion and a rocket brigade newly made available could be moved quickly to the *Seventh Army* sector, and if Eberbach, designated by Hitler to take command of the renewed effort toward Avranches, could have a few days in which to unscramble the assault forces and reassemble them for the attack.[13](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn13)
>
> Hitler, who issued a new order that day, 9 August, was convinced that Eberbach could achieve success if he avoided the mistakes of the first attack, which Hitler considered to have been launched "too early, too weak, and in unfavorable weather." To insure proper timing, Hitler reserved for himself the designation of H Hour. Meanwhile, Eberbach was to prepare to attack southwest from the vicinity of Domfront, then northwest to the ultimate objective, Avranches. To protect Eberbach's left flank, *LXXXI Corps* was to follow the two assault corps echeloned to the left rear. Recognizing that Allied pressure had to be resisted particularly at Falaise, Hitler ordered sufficient antitank weapons, tanks, and assault guns, which were

> coming from the *Fifteenth Army* sector, diverted to the *I SS Panzer Corps* for a strong stand at Falaise. Elsewhere along the front, Hitler prohibited local counterattacks that might lead to serious personnel losses; he also authorized withdrawals to neutralize any penetrations the Allies might effect.[14](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn14)
>
> Although some commanders later called Hitler's order "pure Utopia" and not in keeping with the situation on the ground, the situation in the air, and the supply situation--"the apex of conduct by a command \[OKW\] ignorant of front line conditions, taking upon itself the right to judge the situation from East Prussia"--the commanders facing the crisis in Normandy reorganized for a renewed attempt.[15](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn15) They planned to have the *LXXXIV Corps* pull the *116th Panzer Division* out of the front for assembly; they hoped to withdraw the *84th Division* to a shorter line east of Perriers-en-Beauficel; they instructed the *XLVII Panzer Corps* to withdraw the *2d Panzer Division* somewhat and pull out the *1st SS Panzer Division* for assembly. The *1st SS* and *116th Panzer Divisions* were then to be concentrated in forward assembly areas under *LVIII Panzer Corps* to provide impetus for the new attack. The *Seventh Army* also expected to receive the *9th Panzer Division's* Panther battalion and two mortar *(werfer)* brigades to bolster the second effort. The new attack was to be launched, as Hitler wished, under Eberbach's command and from the Mortain-Domfront area toward St. Hilaire and eventually Avranches.
>
> Leaving command of the *Fifth Panzer Army* to Panzergeneraloberst Josef (Sepp) Dietrich, formerly the commander of the *I SS Panzer Corps,* Eberbach, somewhat against his will, took command of *Panzer Group Eberbach.* His headquarters, formed for the express purpose of making the second attack to Avranches on 11 August, was directly under *Army Group B.* Eberbach assembled a skeleton staff of great ability that included Lt. Col. Guenther von Kluge, the field marshal's son, as chief of staff, and Maj. Arthur von Eckesparre, formerly Rommel's G-4, as operations officer. The command was nevertheless deficient in personnel and equipment and could function only with the aid of the *Seventh Army* staff or a corps headquarters. Despite these handicaps and the additional one of Eberbach's pessimism, the provisional headquarters began to plan the attack in detail.[16](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn16)
>
> It did not take Eberbach long to conclude that he could not attack on 11 August. He felt that he would probably have to commit part of his attack forces to protect his assembly areas and thus would not be able to assemble his troops by that date. Judging that only 77 Mark IV and 47 Panther tanks were available for the attack, he wanted more. He also requested vehicle replacements and additional ammunition and POL supplies. All this would take time. Most important, however, Eberbach believed that because of Allied air superiority he could attack only after dark and in early morning when ground fog might provide concealment. At best, his movements would be restricted to the six

> hours between 0400 and 1000. If his assault forces failed to reach their objective during that period, the events at Mortain would be repeated--his troops would be smashed by Allied air and artillery. To attack after nightfall, he needed the light of the waning moon, not to be had until 20 August. At that time also, according to meteorologists, the weather would change and become unfavorable for aerial activity. Thus 20 August, not 11 August, in Eberbach's estimation, was the best date for launching the new attack toward Avranches.[17](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn17)
>
> While Eberbach was coming to his conclusions, a new threat developed. Just as it appeared that the Canadian attack on the north flank was halted, the Americans on the south flank "unmistakably swerved" north from le Mans toward Alençon. As Kluge evaluated the situation on the evening of 10 August, if the changed direction of the XV Corps drive was connected with the Canadian effort toward Falaise, he faced the threat of double envelopment. Furthermore, the weak forces of the *LXXXI Corps* could not possibly protect the army group on the southern flank. Nor could the *LXXXI Corps* keep the vital Alençon-Flers line open. Instead of continuing the attack toward Avranches, Kluge thought it "worth considering whether the spearheads of the enemy columns driving north should not be smashed by a . .&bnbsp; swiftly executed panzer thrust." He requested Jodl to get a decision on this matter from Hitler.[18](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn18)
>
> Hitler replied with queries. He wanted clarification on why Eberbach could not mount his attack toward Avranches before 20 August. He wanted to know what Funck, the commander of the *XLVII Panzer Corps,* thought of resuming that attack. Hitler interpreted Kluge's suggestion as meaning an attack to regain le Mans and asked when, with what forces, and from where such an attack could be launched. Finally, he asked when the *nth Panzer Division,* if he ordered it moved from southern France, could reach the Loire River near Tours so that it could support an attack on le Mans--for if another attack toward Avranches could not be mounted before 20 August, Hitler conceded, an attack against the U.S. XV Corps "must perforce be carried out before that time."[19](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn19)
>
> Before he answered Hitler's questions, Kluge phoned Eberbach. The commanders were in agreement that a new attempt to gain Avranches was out of the question, at least for the moment. The obstacles to a renewed drive toward Avranches were not only the strong opposition at Mortain and the unrelaxed pressure elsewhere along the front but also the uncomfortable thought that the Canadians attacking south toward Falaise and the Americans attacking north toward Alençon seemed to be converging on a common point. If the Allied forces joined, the major part of the German forces would be encircled. The Canadian and American spearheads had to be blunted immediately, and since the Canadians were apparently stopped, action ought to be taken against the Americans,

>
> Kluge informed Hitler to this effect an hour and a half later. All commanders agreed, Kluge said, that the prospect of continuing the attack to Avranches was unfavorable because the enemy had reinforced, surprise had been lost, and the attacking force needed time to bring forward more troops, tanks, gasoline, and ammunition, and required certain weather conditions. There was no possibility of fulfilling the necessary preattack requirements within a few days. As for an attack against the XV Corps, Kluge would need at least two of the best panzer divisions, which he envisioned attacking from the vicinity of Alençon. The direction of the attack would depend on developments. He hoped to make his approach march during the night of 11 August and attack on 13 August with the hope of completing the operation three days later. The *11th Panzer Division* in southern France could not reach the area of operations in time to lend support.[21](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn21)
>
> Kluge was again in touch with Hitler's headquarters at noon on 11 August. He had conferred with Hausser and Eberbach, and all three commanders were convinced that an attack on Avranches had no prospect of success. The situation on the extreme southern flank of the army group was deteriorating so rapidly--the *9th Panzer Division,* for example, was fighting near Alençon with its back close to vital supply installations--that immediate measures had to be taken in that area. Kluge needed more armor there. The only practical way to get armor was to pull three divisions out of the line--the *116th* that night, the *1st SS* and *2d Panzer Divisions* during the following night. These units could be released only if the *Seventh Army* salient at Mortain were reduced by withdrawal to the east. This meant abandoning hope of a breakthrough to the sea at Avranches. A clear-cut decision had to be made at once. In Kluge's mind, the decision could be only one thing: attack the XV Corps in the vicinity of Alençon with panzer divisions pulled out of the line and bring additional infantry divisions forward to launch an attack against the XV Corps from east to west, thus stabilizing the situation on the army group left flank.[22](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn22)
>
> After further discussion with Jodl in midafternoon, Kluge issued a written report to Hitler and disseminated it to his subordinate commands, probably as a warning order subject to Hitler's approval. In this report, Kluge projected the following actions. The *Seventh Army* was to withdraw its Mortain salient that night. An attack force--composed of the *XLVII Panzer* and *LXXXI Corps* headquarters, the *1st SS, 2d,* and *116th Panzer Divisions,* two *werfer* brigades, and possibly an additional panzer division--was to assemble in the Carrouges area and prepare to attack during the early morning hours of 14 August, one day later than Kluge had originally contemplated. The attack, with three divisions abreast, was to be launched in a southeasterly direction

> along the Lalacelle-la Hutte axis--generally a thrust starting northwest of Alençon and cutting across the le Mans-- Alençon road.[23](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn23)
>
> Hitler's response to Kluge's report reached *Army Group B* headquarters late that evening. Acknowledging the new set of circumstances that had come into being, Hitler, though reiterating his intention to attack westward to the sea (this time by way of Mayenne), admitted that "the serious threat to the deep southern flank" of the army group required quick action. He therefore approved Kluge's plan to have Eberbach launch an attack with an armored corps from the vicinity of Carrouges. But instead of an effort envisaged by Kluge as an attempt to destroy the American spearheads driving north toward Alençon, Hitler envisioned an attack against the deep west flank of the U.S. XV Corps, the axis of the thrust passing in a more southerly direction across the Sillé-le-Guillaume-Beaumont road. In order to disengage the necessary forces, Hitler agreed to "a minor withdrawal of the front between Sourdeval and Mortain." He retained the *11th Panzer Division* in southern France as the only mobile reserve in the *Nineteenth Army* sector because Kluge assured him that it could not reach the Normandy front in time to attack near Alençon, and perhaps because he was apprehensive over the imminent Allied invasion of southern France.[24](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn24)
>
> Thus, while the Germans awaited reinforcements and favorable weather for another try at Avranches in compliance with Hitler's wishes, Eberbach was to make an effort to eradicate the American threat to Alençon. To make this possible, the *Seventh Army* during the night of 11 August began to withdraw eastward from Mortain.[25](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn25)
