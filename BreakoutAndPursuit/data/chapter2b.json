      "Sub-event_summary": "Upon the Allied landing on 6 June 1944, German command lacked a unified defensive policy. Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt (OB WEST) advocated a mobile defense with a strong central strategic reserve to counter the main thrust after identification, while Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel (Army Group B) favored static defense on the beaches, anticipating Allied air superiority would prevent timely movement of reserves, thereby promoting construction of the Atlantic Wall.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_10": "German strategy in July was rooted in the events of June. When the Allies landed on the Normandy beaches on 6 June 1944, the Germans were without a firmly enunciated policy of defense. The OB WEST commander, Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt, and the Army Group B commander, Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel, were in vague but basic disagreement on how best to meet the expected Allied invasion. Rundstedt tended to favor maintaining a strong strategic reserve centrally located, so that after he determined the main invasion effort he could mass the reserve and destroy the Allies before they could reinforce their beachhead. Sometimes called the concept of mobile defense, this was a normal operational technique. Rommel presupposed Allied air superiority, and he argued that the Germans would be unable to move a centrally located reserve to the battlefield since the Allies would control the air in that area; he believed it necessary to defeat the Allied invaders on the beaches. Sometimes called the concept of static defense, this theory gave impetus to the construction of the Atlantic Wall."
