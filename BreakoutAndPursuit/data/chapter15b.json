      "Sub-event_summary": "By the evening of 27 July, General Bradley decided to continue the attack to exploit the COBRA breakthrough, prompted by the enemy withdrawal on the Cotentin west coast and strong opposition east of Coutances indicating an attempt to hold open a retreat path for LXXXIV Corps. The Luftwaffe's appearance and Bradley's optimism underscored the favorable situation.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_[29]": "The Post-COBRA Plan In the COBRA plan, General Bradley had not tried to forecast how the operation might end. Instead, he was prepared to choose his course of action from the actual COBRA results. He could halt the offensive and consolidate his forces or continue his attack to exploit a breakthrough. By the evening of 27 July it was apparent that the success of COBRA warranted a continuation of the attack, and Bradley decided to exploit his gains and broaden and extend his effort.",
        "Paragraph_[30]": "Specifically, the enemy withdrawal along the west coast of the Cotentin on 27 July--later judged the decisive consequence of COBRA--seemed to offer an opportunity to hasten the withdrawal and turn it into a rout.",
        "Paragraph_[31]": "The fact that the opposition east of Coutances was so strong appeared particularly significant-- the forces there were obviously trying \"to hold open the door of retreat for the LXXXIV Corps.\" Even the Luftwaffe put in an appearance--a total of thirty planes made eight daylight and sixteen night raids.",
        "Paragraph_[32]": "The Germans had realized the danger of becoming isolated on the Cotentin west coast and had attempted to escape encirclement by withdrawing. \"To say that . . . [we are] riding high tonight is putting it mildly,\" General Bradley wrote General Eisenhower. \"Things on our front really look good.\""

The only hope the Germans could have of stemming their retreat was to gain refuge behind the Sée River at Avranches. The \"bits and pieces,\" the \"shattered remnants,\" and the \"battered portions\" of the units in the Cotentin were hardly in shape to make a stand unless fresh troops came forward to reinforce them, and no fresh troops seemed available.",
        "Paragraph_[34]": "Thus the German course of action would probably be an attempt to erect a hasty defensive line between Avranches and the town of Vire, a line along the south bank of the Sée River and the high ground south of Villedieu-les-Poelës and St. Sever-Calvados. The possibility was also present that the Germans might counterattack from the east with two panzer divisions, but this hardly seemed likely at the moment. The significant conclusion was that \"destruction of LXXXIV Corps is believed at hand, and the destruction of II Parachute Corps is an immediate possibility.\""

Gen. Courtney H. Hodges, the Deputy Commander, First Army, would replace him as the First Army commander. It seemed as though the moment for the change might coincide with the end of the exploitation growing out of COBRA.",

He asked General Hodges \"to keep close track of\" the three corps on the left. He informally appointed General Patton a second deputy commander and assigned him the mission of supervising the activities of the VIII Corps on the right. The VIII Corps, scheduled to come under control of the Third Army, was to act as a bridge to link the Post-COBRA exploitation and the entrance of U.S. troops into Brittany.

        "Paragraph_[44]": "In the meantime, although COBRA and its consequences were an American responsibility, General Montgomery, as the Allied ground commander, was vitally concerned to promote progress on the American front. To create a diversion for COBRA, he had directed General Crerar to launch a holding attack on the Canadian front from Caen toward Falaise. In compliance, the 2d Canadian Corps had attacked on the morning of 25 July, at the same time that COBRA jumped off. The Canadian attack met such resistance, and set off such strong German counterattacks east of the Orne by two panzer divisions, that Montgomery halted the attack at the end of the first day. Enemy strength in the Caen sector was obviously too great for anything less than an all-out offensive effort, which Montgomery was unwilling or unable to mount. On the other hand, the presence of formidable enemy forces near Caen made it necessary for the British to exercise caution. Montgomery still considered holding Caen, the pivot of the entire Allied front in Normandy, his principal task, and to that end he set in motion deception measures and air and artillery activity to keep the enemy off balance and prevent him from making a serious threat against Caen. It was this that had brought Kluge to the Caen front on 27 July at the height of the COBRA action."

        "Paragraph_[45]": "Despite his preoccupation with Caen, Montgomery endeavored to assist COBRA. Looking elsewhere along the eastern portion of the Allied front, he discovered that there seemed to be little if any German armor in the Caumont sector. He decided that an attack south from Caumont along the British-American boundary by the Second British Army would take advantage of German weakness and be of value. Not only would it help COBRA by preventing the Germans from dispatching forces westward across the Vire River against the Americans, it would also ameliorate the situation at Caen by drawing German armored reserves away from that sector. With the former intention his avowed purpose, Montgomery ordered General Dempsey to attack south from Caumont on 30 July in an operation code-named BLUECOAT.",
        "Paragraph_[46]": "Like GOODWOOD, the attempted breakthrough effort south of Caen earlier in July, which had raised doubts concerning Montgomery's primary and secondary motives, BLUECOAT had its ambiguous aspects. If the original intention was to hold German forces in place, thus keeping them from crossing the Vire and interfering with COBRA, BLUECOAT came too late to influence the panzer division that Kluge was moving from the Caumont region toward the American front. Yet because of the American success, it seemed likely that the Germans would make a general withdrawal in the Cotentin and try to swing their entire left flank back to Avranches. To do so they needed a firmly held pivot point. A dominating hill complex culminating in Mont Pinçon--five to eight miles south of the Caumont-Villers-Bocage line--in the British zone of advance seemed suitable for this purpose. If the British denied the Germans the potential pivot point and got behind those German forces trying to swing west to face the Americans, the German withdrawal might disintegrate. This became the final purpose of BLUECOAT. With the object of moving from Caumont through the Forêt l'Evêque to the town of Vire, the British were to attack on 30 July."
