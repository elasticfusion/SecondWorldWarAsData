      "Sub-event_summary": "Allied armies pursued multiple objectives including Channel ports, Pas-de-Calais V-weapon sites, liberation of northwest Europe, destruction of German forces, with primary goal the Rhine River. Belief in imminent German collapse if Rhine crossed quickly; West Wall seen as key defensive line if reached before German reorganization.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_1": "At the end of August 1944 the Allied armies were like knights of old who set out in quest of the Holy Grail but were not averse to slaying dragons and rescuing damsels in distress along the way. The Allies desired the Channel ports to assuage their logistical aches; the Pas-de-Calais coastal area to neutralize the German V-weapons; the liberation of northwest France, Belgium, and the Netherlands; and the destruction of the enemy forces remaining between the Seine and Germany. But their fundamental objective was the Rhine River.<sup>[1](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn1)</sup> *(See [Map XV](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/maps/USA-E-Breakout-XV.jpg).)*",
        "Paragraph_2": "Some Allied commanders believed that an immediate crossing of the Rhine would lead to quick capture of the Ruhr. The apparently disintegrating German military organization then would collapse and carry with it a tottering German political structure. That would be the end of the war.<sup>[2](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn2)</sup> As the First Army G-2 put it:",
        "Paragraph_3": "> Critical situations on the Western and Eastern front, in the Balkans, in Finland, and in German industry, particularly oil, must deprive any sane German of the last vestiges of hope. The only important question is how long it will take the vast majority of Germans in and out of the military forces, who can accept surrender to the Allies without fear of death or dishonor, to overthrow the elaborate and powerful system of control exercised by the relatively few for whom surrender means death as criminals and who will naturally choose to fight so long as there is one brave or fanatical German soldier between them and the enemy.<sup>[3](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn3)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_4": "Threatened also by the Soviet advance in the east, which had come to within one hundred and fifty miles of the German border, the Germans no longer seemed to have sufficient forces to make a stand anywhere short of the West Wall—or Siegfried Line, as the Allies called it. A complex of permanent-type fortifications of varying strength and depth along the western frontier of Germany, the West Wall extended from the Dutch border near Kleve to Switzerland north of Basle. To the Allies, the only sound military strategy for the Germans seemed to be to rush repairs on these fortifications and immediately withdraw from France to them, using delaying action to retard the Allied advance.<sup>[4](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn4)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_5": "*--676--* <a id=\"page677\"></a> * * * > On the basis of this estimate, the overriding Allied goal became the desire to reach the Rhine before the Germans could organize an effective defense at the West Wall. The West Wall was no longer the impressive shield it had once been. The Germans had neglected and partially dismantled it after their victories in 1940. They had stripped most of its armament for use at the Atlantic Wall. Its works had fallen into disrepair, and no appreciable number of troops manned the line in the summer of 1944. Yet the West Wall remained an important psychological barrier for both the Germans and the Allies.<sup>[5](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn5)</sup> If the Allies could reach it before the Germans could man it (either with troops retreating from Normandy or with others already in Germany), the Allies would probably be able to get through to the Rhine with little difficulty. The pursuit east of the Seine was thus to display some of the aspects of a race.<sup>[6](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn6)</sup>"

That kind of maneuver, the Germans thought, would have led to the complete destruction of the *Fifth Panzer* and *Seventh Armies* and would have created an irreparable gap between the *Fifteenth* and *First Armies.* The path to the northeast--to Germany--would have been undefended, and further resistance in France would have been futile. Since the Allies had not elected this course, the Germans continued to fall back toward the Schelde estuary, the Albert Canal, and the Meuse River, trying to maintain a fairly orderly withdrawal in the hope that a continuous front might be re-established there. The ports of",

Screening their landward flank with mobile units, they hoped by delaying action to blunt Allied spearheads thrusting into that flank and thereby to gain time to reach the Schelde-Albert-Meuse line. German commanders insisted that the Allied pursuit was hesitant and that orderly resistance could be successful despite inferiority in strength and resources. Yet congested roads, traffic bottlenecks, an insufficient number of bridges and ferries, the fatigue of continuous movement, Allied strafing from the air, and the lack of information on the general situation created a depressing feeling of defeat.<sup>[9](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn9)</sup>"

Bypassed Montdidier pocket (79th Division eliminated), minimal resistance, captured city with 30th Division. Halt due to gasoline shortage and orders; airborne drop canceled.",

        "Paragraph_16": "This projected advance resembled the third envelopment that earlier Patton had tentatively planned east of the Seine. In effect the maneuver would reinstate the earlier boundary line that had been drawn by Montgomery and then changed at Bradley's request. At the conclusion of its northward drive, the First U.S. Army would have compressed the British and Canadians into a narrow zone ending at the Schelde estuary. The British and Canadians would then be facing out toward the sea. Apparently without consulting higher headquarters, General Bradley ordered General Hodges to execute the maneuver.",
        "Paragraph_17": "The most important objective of the shift in direction was the city of Tournai, Belgium, and during the afternoon of 31 August the First Army G-3, Brig. Gen. Truman C. Thorson, arrived at Corlett's XIX Corps headquarters to outline the new plan. Instead of driving through Montdidier and Peronne and turning gently eastward toward Mons, Corlett was to go north beyond Peronne to Tournai, a hundred miles ahead of the corps' leading units, and then north to Ghent, forty miles farther. The immediate objective, Tournai, was to be taken within forty-eight hours--at the latest by midnight, 2 September.<sup>[15](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn15)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_18": "To get to the Belgian border in the short time allowed, Corlett used all his available trucks, chiefly of artillery and antiaircraft units, to motorize two regiments of the 79th Division and one of the 30th--this in addition to the organic transportation that enabled each infantry division to motorize one regimental combat team. With the 2d Armored Division leading two almost completely motorized infantry divisions, the XIX Corps set forth to bypass resistance and make night marches if necessary in order to reach Tournai at the appointed hour. \"Get a good night's sleep and don't worry,\" the armored commander, General Brooks, advised Corlett, \"it's in the bag.\" Nearby, the excited corps chief of staff exclaimed, \"Hot pursuit!\"<sup>[18](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn18)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_19": "Col. John H. Collier's CCA of the 2d Armored Division crossed the Somme early on 1 September after bypassing a pocket of resistance at Montdidier, which the 79th Division soon eliminated, and on 2 September--two hours before the midnight deadline--reached Tournai. While a regiment of the 30th took the city, both infantry divisions assembled in the objective area around midnight. General White's CCB arrived after a two and a half hour engagement with an enemy column that resulted in the destruction of 96 German vehicles and 28 guns. The Reserve had just enough gasoline to reach the objective but instead assembled about ten miles short of it to keep a small supply of fuel on hand for emergencies. Except for these two instances of resistance, the corps had advanced against only the faintest kind of opposition.<sup>[19](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn19)</sup> Even destroyed bridges had failed to slow the rate of advance. In keeping with procedure that had become standard, engineers laid a treadway bridge first, then built a Bailey bridge nearby. When the Bailey was completed, the traffic was diverted to it, and the treadway was pulled up for the next crossing.",
        "Paragraph_20": "American incursion into the British zone had begun to look like a habit, and one of General Montgomery's aides visited Corlett on the afternoon of 2 September to protest. Montgomery wanted XIX Corps halted short of Tournai so that American troops would not interfere with the British advance, but it was too late to stop the columns. When Hodges informed Corlett later in the evening that a change in plans made",
        "Paragraph_21": "*--680--* <a id=\"page681\"></a> * * * > a halt necessary, the leading troops were virtually on the objective.<sup>[20](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn20)</sup>",
        "Paragraph_22": "The XIX Corps halted at Tournai, as much because the units were out of gasoline as because of orders. While British troops, who had reached the vicinity of Tournai shortly after the Americans, swept beyond, XIX Corps processed a disappointing total of only 1,300 prisoners. A small captured barge loaded with German gasoline enabled reconnaissance units to mop up the area. Meanwhile, Corlett waited for further instructions and gasoline supplies.",
        "Paragraph_23": "The Tournai airborne operation had in the meantime been canceled. Awakened at daybreak on 3 September by a complaint from Montgomery that American troops were blocking the roads at Tournai, Bradley was satisfied that they had also blocked the airborne drop.<sup>[21](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn21)</sup> General Eisenhower had tentatively decided on 2 September to cancel the operation on the announced theory that the purpose of the drop--to bar German escape routes to the east--had been achieved by ground action. After conferring with Montgomery, the Supreme Commander confirmed his decision. In the meantime, the commander of the First Allied Airborne Army, General Brereton, had announced poor weather conditions as the official reason for canceling the drop.<sup>[22](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn22)</sup>"

Instead of driving northeastward from Montcornet and Rethel toward Namur and Liège, Collins was ordered to turn north and drive through the towns of Avesnes, Maubeuge, and Mons. General Collins' first concern was for the gap that would develop on the right between his corps and the Third Army. When he asked Hodges who was to fill the gap, he learned that that was his own problem. Though Collins thought at first that he would have to leave a division behind for the purpose, he decided instead to cover the gap with the 4th Cavalry Group, reinforced by a battalion each of light tanks, motorized artillery, tank destroyers, and infantry, three Engineer companies, and a platoon of a Medical collecting company. Even though he had been diverted to the north to trap Germans, Collins still had his eyes fixed on the West Wall. Anxious to continue northeastward across the Meuse, he instructed the 4th Cavalry not only to maintain contact with Patton but also to seize a Meuse bridgehead near M&ecute;zières. Meanwhile, he swerved the 3d Armored Division--which was moving toward Sedan and Charleville--onto new roads to the north toward Hirson and Vervins.",

        "Paragraph_27": "The 3d Armored Division drove due north on the highway through Vervins, and by nightfall of 2 September spearheads were approaching Mons. Hodges, who had notified Corlett and Gerow on 1 September that there was talk of swinging eastward again toward the Rhine, was unable to reach Collins by telephone that day. Thus, he did not transmit news that might have acted as a brake on the VII Corps drive to the north. On 2 September Hodges received instructions to \"curl up\" the VII Corps short of Mons and hold because of gasoline shortages. But again he was unable to get word to the leading elements of the corps. On the morning of 3 September the 3d Armored Division took firm possession of Mons. Yet armored columns were strung out for twenty-five miles behind, as far back as Avesnes. By that time the 9th Division on the east flank had moved to Charleroi, and 1st Division units were pushing into Avesnes, on the tail of the armored units.<sup>[27](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn27)</sup>",

While the 3d Armored Division set up a line of north-south roadblocks along the Avesnes-Mons road to cut further German movement toward the northeast, the 1st Division attacked northwest from Avesnes into a confused and milling mass of retreating enemy. Blocked on the east by the 3d Armored Division, pushed on the west by the XIX Corps near Valenciennes, hemmed in on the south from Cambrai to Landrecies by the V Corps, about to be cut off on the north by the British advance beyond Tournai, and jabbed on the southeast by the 1st Division, a large, amorphous enemy group was pocketed.",
        "Paragraph_31": "Many of the troops trapped near Mons belonged to three corps--the *LVIII Panzer,* the *II SS,* and the *LXXIV--* that had earlier been under the control of *Fifth Panzer Army.* Near St. Quentin on the last day of August, the three corps headquarters had been out of contact with any higher command. Without instructions from above, the three commanders conferred and decided to form a provisional army among themselves. Straube, the *LXXIV Corps* commander, assumed command of the other two corps, while his staff began to function as the provisional army headquarters.",
        "Paragraph_32": "Straube was completely in the dark on what was happening outside his immediate area but, from Allied radio broadcasts and from meager reports occasionally delivered by subordinate headquarters, he estimated that the provisional army was in imminent danger of encirclement. Deciding to withdraw to an area that was naturally suited to a defensive effort, he chose the canal and marsh region near Mons. Since he realized that the faster-moving Americans still might encircle the troops of the three corps, who for the most part traveled on foot, he started an immediate well-planned and well-organized movement.",
        "Paragraph_33": "The main units that Straube controlled were remnants of the *3d Parachute Division,* \"almost insignificant in numbers\"; the *6th Parachute Division,* which had a strength of about two infantry battalions plus a few heavy-caliber weapons; the *18th Luftwaffe Field Division,* in one-battalion strength; and two infantry divisions that were \"hardly useful.\" Around these forces had gathered fragmentary units, stragglers, depot personnel, and a host of miscellaneous troops. Harassed from the air, ambushed by Resistance groups, attacked by Allied spearheads, finally encircled near Mons, the provisional army, with little ammunition, fuel, or communications, blundered into American roadblocks and upon contact was thrown into confusion.<sup>[28](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn28)</sup>",

Other American tanks nearby opened fire down a straight stretch of road. When an early round set a German vehicle ablaze, illuminating others, it was \"like shooting sitting pigeons.\" At daybreak tankers of the 3d Armored Division discovered that they had destroyed a column a mile long. During the ensuing confusion, when Medical Corps",

On the afternoon of 3 September alone, the 3d Armored and 1st Divisions took between 7,500 and 9,000 prisoners. The IX Tactical Air Command claimed the destruction of 851 motor vehicles, 50 armored vehicles, 652 horse-drawn vehicles, and 485 persons.<sup>[31](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn32.html#fn31)</sup> In three days about 25,000 prisoners were taken, remnants of twenty disorganized divisions.
