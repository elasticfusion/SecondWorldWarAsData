The corps had two divisions in the line: the*708th,* with most of its strength west of the Sarthe River (where it had been badly hurt by the 90th Division), seemed \"doomed to failure\" by its poor fighting quality; the *9th Panzer* (less its Panther battalion, diverted to the Falaise defenses) deployed its well-trained troops more directly in the path of the American advance but had some elements committed west of the Sarthe and was to have difficulty concentrating for employment as an entity. On the east flank, the corps commander felt \"there were no units worth mentioning.\" Backing up the line were remnants of *Panzer Lehr,* consisting almost entirely of supply forces and thus of \"negligible combat strength,\" and remnants of the *352d Division,* which had been pulled out of the *Seventh Army* line for wholesale re-constitution.

More frequent roadblocks, utilizing tanks rather than antitank guns, and concentrated artillery fire encountered by the corps on 11 August appeared to bear out this concern, prompting Haislip to order his armored divisions to bypass the forest on both sides.[60](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn60) To cover the resultant separation of his columns, Haislip ordered three artillery battalions to interdict the exits from the forest and requested an air strike on the forest with incendiary oil bombs to burn and smoke out enemy forces. As it turned out, the Germans had evacuated the woods. French and American armor bypassed the area without undue interference.[61](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn61)"

Eberbach visited Alençon that afternoon and found the sector in confusion. The *LXXXI Corps* command post was threatened by the American advance. Rear area service service troops were fleeing northward to the accompaniment of nearby blasts from the guns of American tanks. Burning vehicles, knocked out by Allied planes and tanks, littered the countryside. The *9th Panzer Division* had been reduced to the point where Eberbach estimated it consisted of only a battalion of infantry, a battalion of artillery, and perhaps a dozen tanks.

The *XLVII Panzer Corps* headquarters, having turned over its responsibility at Mortain to the *LVIII Panzer Corps,* arrived at Argentan. Since the *LXXXI Corps* headquarters had been severed from its divisions in the Argentan sector by the American attack and was out of contact with them, the *XLVII Panzer Corps* took control of the remnants of the *9th Panzer Division* in the Ecouves forest. When a strong infantry battalion of the *116th Panzer Division,* which was moving from the Mortain sector, became available early in the afternoon, the *XLVII Panzer Corps* sent it toward Sées. The battalion reached Mortree in time to block the 5th Armored Division attack."

The *2d Panzer Division* arrived in better condition, but only at half strength; the other half was to require an additional day for the road march.

Eberbach estimated that the *1st SS* had thirty tanks, the *2d* twenty-five, and the *116th* fifteen.

        "Paragraph_175": "Loss of Alençon and Sées completely changed the situation for the Germans. Kluge had suggested an attack against the XV Corps spearheads. Hitler had wanted Eberbach to attack well behind the spearheads. Either attack, if launched, might well have dealt the U.S. corps a crippling blow. Instead, the American advance upsetting German offensive plans, it had already deprived the *Seventh Army* of its supply base, thereby making Hausser's forces entirely dependent for logistical support on the *Fifth Panzer Army.* The ammunition and fuel supply situation, as a consequence, was \"dreadfully serious.\" Only three main roads were available for supply and troop movements. Even these the Germans could use only at night because of Allied aircraft and excellent flying weather. All the roads were so congested that vehicular traffic moved at a walk. Some committed divisions existed in name alone, and all were far below authorized strengths. On 12 August the French and American armored divisions claimed almost a hundred tanks destroyed and nearly fifteen hundred prisoners taken. Most alarming, the Germans could no longer disregard the fact that if the Canadians reached Falaise and the Americans reached Argentan, only thirteen miles would separate them from achieving a literal encirclement of the German forces on the western front. With this menace a distinct possibility, Eberbach redoubled his efforts to establish a stable defense at Argentan.[66](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn25.html#fn66)"
