Unfortunately, Kluge had not been idle.",

The panzer division had been relieved from frontline duty on 22 July by the *326th Infantry Division* (which had come from the Pas-de-Calais), and the armored unit had moved into reserve southwest of Caen. Having had a few days of respite from battle, the *2d Panzer Division* was to move westward and across the Vire River to launch a counterattack designed to close the gap."

        "Paragraph_[44]": "As events developed, these arrange ments were too late, for on 28 July the *2d Panzer Division* was assembling west of the Vire River on a small plateau around Tessy-sur-Vire. The panzer troops gathered behind an east-west tributary of the Vire River--the stream running south of Moyon and Troisgots--and in the area immediately northwest of Tessy for an attack to the northwest. To protect the assembly of the *2d Panzer Division,* Kluge had instructed Hausser to have the *II Parachute Corps,* which still straddled the Vire River, establish a strong defensive line from Moyon eastward through Conde-sur-Vire and Bieville to Caumont, where it was to tie in with the *LVIII Panzer Corps*.<sup>[59](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn59)</sup> Although the line east of the Vire--from Conde-sur-Vire through Bieville--had successfully delayed the V Corps north of Torigni-sur-Vire, the slashing COBRA attack of the 30th Division and CCA had invalidated positions along that line west of the Vire. CCA had already outflanked the line on the west by reaching Villebaudon on 28 July, and the 30th Division was approaching Troisgots."

Two co-ordinated attacks against Troisgots--the bastion of the defensive line--by all three regiments of the 30th Division abreast on 30 July and artillery fire exceeding thrice the amount usually expended still failed to propel the division beyond the line of departure.

The roads leading west from Tessy were excellent for supporting German armored thrusts toward Villebaudon and Percy. To prevent the panzer troops from cutting the north-south le Mesnil-Herman-VillebaudonPercy road, General Rose tried to erect a barrier along his eastern boundary. He had divided CCA into three task forces, each consisting of a company of the 22d Infantry, a medium tank company of the 66th Armored Regiment, a platoon of light tanks, and supporting units. Since one task force was already in Villebaudon, he sent the other two south and southeast from le Mesnil-Herman toward Moyon, giving them the eventual objective of cutting the east-west Villebaudon-Tessy highway and thereby providing flank protection for the main attack to Percy."

From positions forming an arc from Moyon through Villebaudon to Percy, all three regiments of the 29th Division--the 116th on the left (north), the 175th in the center, and the 115th on the right (the 115th after relief near Percy by the 28th Division's 110th Infantry)--were to attack eastward toward Tessy and support another at tempt by CCA to destroy the bridgehead.

        "Paragraph_[62]": "the artillerymen accepted and fulfilled all fire missions. They marked enemy attack concentrations with red smoke to lead fighter-bombers to lucrative targets. They also engaged enemy tanks at ranges of less than 2,000 yards. Finally, when German fire became too intense, they withdrew to new positions north of Villebaudon. There the 18th and the 65th Field Artillery Battalions were attached to the 14th Armored Field Artillery Battalion, which also assumed operational control of the 44th Field Artillery Battalion through its fire direction center. Controlling the fires of four battalions of 105-mm. howitzers, the 14th also co-ordinated missions for the XIX Corps Artillery, which sent a liaison officer to the battalion for this purpose.[66](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn66) At the end of 30 July, the XIX Corps still was seriously engaged in the Percy-Tessy-sur-Vire area. From the high ground between Percy and Tessy, the Germans shelled the American units effectively and interdicted the roads in the Villebaudon area at will.<sup>[67](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-E-Breakout/fn15.html#fn67)</sup> Still trying to eliminate the German bridgehead at Tessy, General Corlett ordered the attack to resume on 31 July, but with a modification. From positions forming an arc from Moyon through Villebaudon to Percy, all three regiments of the 29th Division--the 116th on the left (north), the 175th in the center, and the 115th on the right (the 115th after relief near Percy by the 28th Division's 110th Infantry)--were to attack eastward toward Tessy and support another at tempt by CCA to destroy the bridgehead. While this attack was in progress, the 28th Division was to move south through Villebaudon to Percy to get into position for a drive south to Vire."

Knocking out the machine gun with grenades, the infantrymen infiltrated into the edge of Tessy. Having understood that Tessy had already been secured by CCA and that he was merely to set up roadblocks there, the company commander was disconcerted when enemy forces appeared and drove his men out helter-skelter."
