        "Paragraph_1": "While awaiting the signal for COBRA to begin, intelligence officers pondered some troublesome questions.¹ Did the enemy defenses on the Lessay-St. Lô road represent the actual main battle position? Were there enough mobile German reserves assembled locally to counter the attack successfully? What major reserves were available to the Germans? Where were they? Where were they likely to be committed? Was the Luftwaffe capable of intervention? Would the Germans employ the V-1, V-2, or some other secret weapon against COBRA?",
        "Paragraph_2": "Barring the appearance of miracle weapons and a miraculous resuscitation of the German Air Force, the enemy was thought capable of only defensive action.",
        "Paragraph_3": "Neither the LXXXIV Corps nor the II Parachute Corps seemed to have local reserves capable of intervening with effect. Nor did either Seventh Army or Panzer Group West appear to have excess troops that might be committed against COBRA.",
        "Paragraph_4": "Even if the Germans somehow assembled a reserve for a counterattack from the base of the Cotentin, they would need more time to concentrate sufficient forces than the Americans thought they themselves needed to achieve the success they expected of COBRA.",
        "Paragraph_5": "Though the Germans might attempt a rigid defense of the Périers-St. Lô line, deficiencies in manpower and supplies made an effective defense doubtful.",
        "Paragraph_6": "The most likely course of enemy action, then, seemed to be a gradual withdrawal accompanied by strong delaying action in terrain favorable to defense, probably along three successive natural defensive lines: between Coutances and Canisy, in the Gavray area, and at the base of the Cotentin near Avranches."
