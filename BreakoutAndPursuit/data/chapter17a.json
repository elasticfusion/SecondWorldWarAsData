        "Paragraph_1": "\"It's a madhouse here,\" Kluge cried in despair as he attempted to describe the situation on the morning of 31 July. At the Seventh Army command post in le Mans, Kluge for the second day was for all intents and purposes commanding the LXXXIV Corps and the Seventh Army, in addition to performing his official duties as commander of Army Group B and OB WEST. \"You can't imagine what it's like,\" he told General der Infanterie Guenther Blumentritt, the OB WEST chief of staff, on the telephone. \"Commanders are completely out of contact [with their troops]. Jodl and Warlimont [Hitler's chief advisers at OKW] ought to come down and see what is taking place.\" Who was to blame? The whole mess had started, it seemed to Kluge, \"with Hausser's fatal decision to break out to the southeast. So far, it appears that only the spearheads of various [American] mobile units are through to Avranches. But it is perfectly clear that everything else will follow. Unless I can get infantry and antitank weapons there, the [left] wing can not hold.\" Apropos of that, Blumentritt said, OKW wanted to know the locations of all the alternate and rearward defenses under construction in Normandy. Kluge did not hide his derision. \"All you can do is laugh out loud,\" he replied. \"Don't they read our dispatches? Haven't they been oriented? They must be living on the moon.\" \"Of course,\" Blumentritt agreed smoothly. Kluge's mood changed. \"Someone has to tell the Fuehrer,\" he said, without designating who was to perform the unpleasant task, \"that if the Americans get through at Avranches they will be out of the woods and they'll be able to do what they want.\" The terrible thing, Kluge said, was that there was not much that anyone could do. \"It's a crazy situation.\""

The responsibility for the crisis, he insisted, lay with Hausser's order for the left wing of the LXXXIV Corps to attack to the southeast. He had discovered that Choltitz had protested Hausser's order, and he felt that this futile protest absolved Choltitz from blame for the subsequent disaster. Troops under the control of the 91st Division had established a thin line from Bréhal to Cérences as early as 28 July, but the American penetration on 31 July near Cérences had \"ripped open the whole western front.\" The inevitable conclusion was that \"Villedieu, springboard for movement east and south, is the anchor-point for Brittany, [and] has to be held under all circumstances or else has to be recaptured.\" But Kluge could do no more than draw conclusions; without an organized front and without adequate communications, he was powerless to influence the course of events."

Fahrmbacher was handicapped in two respects. Though there were many unemployed naval and air force troops in his corps sector, he could not order them to assume ground force missions because they were not under his jurisdiction. The troops directly under his control and therefore available to him were generally of two types--static troops guarding the coast line and units that had escaped from the Cotentin after taking heavy losses. Both lacked sufficient transport to make them mobile. Fahrmbacher felt that he could not perform his mission at Avranches, but he tried anyway."
