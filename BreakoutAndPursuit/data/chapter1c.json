      "Sub-event_summary": "With the capture of Cherbourg concluding the initial phase of continental operations at the end of June 1944, General Eisenhower faced a choice between directing forces eastward toward the Seine ports (Le Havre and Rouen) for a direct thrust into Germany or southward toward the Breton ports (principally St. Nazaire, Lorient, and Brest). The eastward option appeared bolder but risky without evident German withdrawal or collapse. A southward American advance to secure Breton ports, supported by British and Canadian operations through Caen toward the Seine, was deemed more logical, though significantly impeded by terrain characteristics.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_30": "With the capture of Cherbourg at the end of June marking the close of the first phase of continental operations, General Eisenhower had the choice in the next phase of directing action east toward the Seine ports of Le Havre and Rouen, or south toward the Breton ports, principally St. Nazaire, Lorient, and Brest. A move to the Seine ports, a more direct thrust toward Germany, was the bolder course of action, but unless the Germans were already withdrawing from France or at the point of collapse, success appeared dubious. More logical was an American drive southward to capture the Breton ports while the British and Canadians covered American operations by striking through Caen and later toward the Seine. A major impediment to this course of action was the terrain. (Map 1)"

On the Allied left was the Caen-Falaise plain, gently rolling open country of cultivated fields and pastures, dry and firm ground suitable for large-scale armored operations and airfield construction. Facing the Allied center between the Orne and Vire Rivers were the northern fringes of a sprawling mass of broken ground--small hills, low ridges, and narrow valleys--gradually rising in height toward the south. West of the Vire River in the Carentan area was a marshy depression crisscrossed by sluggish streams and drainage ditches. On the extreme right of the Allied front, between the marshland and the coast, a cluster of hills dominated the countryside and gave the Germans a solid anchor for their left flank."

      "Sub-event": "Impact of Hedgerows (Bocage) on Operations",
      "Sub-event_summary": "The Norman hedgerow system—earth banks topped with dense vegetation—compartmentalized the battlefield into small, enclosed fields, severely restricting maneuver, obscuring observation, hindering artillery adjustment, and limiting armor and supporting arms effectiveness. This natural and man-made feature strongly favored defensive operations and posed significant tactical challenges to Allied advances.",
      "Sub-event_fulltext": {
        "Paragraph_32": "With the exception of the Caen-Falaise plain, the battlefield had a compartmentalized character that was bound to impose limitations on the Allies. It restricted maneuver and by the same token favored the German defense. The natural limitations were further aggravated by a man-made feature encountered at every turn, the hedgerow, the result of the practice of Norman farmers for centuries of enclosing each plot of arable land, pasture as well as orchard, no matter how small.",
        "Paragraph_33": "The hedgerow is a fence, half earth, half hedge. The wall at the base is a dirt parapet that varies in thickness from one to four or more feet and in height from three to twelve feet. Growing out of the wall is a hedge of hawthorn, brambles, vines, and trees, in thickness from one to three feet, in height from three to fifteen feet. Originally property demarcations, hedgerows protect crops and cattle from the ocean winds that sweep across the land. They provide the inhabitants with firewood. Delimiting each field, they break the terrain into numerous walled enclosures. Since the fields are tiny, about 200 by 400 yards in size, the hedgerows are innumerable. Because the fields are irregular in shape, the hedgerows follow no logical pattern.",
        "Paragraph_34": "Each field has an opening in the hedgerows for human beings, cattle, and wagons. For passage to fields that do not lie adjacent to a road, innumerable wagon trails wind among the hedgerows. The trails appear to be sunken lanes, and where the hedgerows are high and the tops overarch and shut out the light, they form a cavelike labyrinth, gloomy and damp.",
        "Paragraph_35": "From a tactical point of view, each field is a tiny terrain compartment. Several adjoining fields together form a natural defensive position echeloned in depth. The abundant vegetation and ubiquitous trees provide effective camouflage, obstruct observation, hinder the adjustment of artillery and heavy weapons fire, and limit the use of armor and the supporting arms.",
        "Paragraph_36": "The hedgerow is the most persistent feature in the Cotentin. Unimpressed by fine terrain distinctions, American soldiers called the whole area the hedgerow country, often simply \"this goddam country.\" Many troops had already become familiar with it in June, and before long many more would come to know and detest it."
