        "Paragraph_38": "To Bayerlein, commander of Panzer Lehr, the bombardment on 24 July obviously signaled the beginning of a major American ground attack. Yet Bayerlein was able to influence the battle little. The disruption of his communications to forward units and the confusion that resulted made it difficult to organize a co-ordinated defense against the ground attack that followed the bombing. Consequently, Bayerlein was more than gratified by the situation at the end of the day. Ignorant of the fact that Allied plans had gone awry and that the Americans had mounted only a limited objective attack, Bayerlein congratulated himself on the achievement of his troops. Bayerlein congratulated himself on the achievement of his troops. They had apparently repelled a major American effort and prevented the troops from crossing the Périers-St. Lô highway. Bayerlein congratulated himself on the achievement of his troops. Panzer Lehr had flinched under the weight of the bombardment, but it had not given way; the front line remained intact and neither corps nor army reserves had been committed. However, losses from the bombing and the ground attack numbered about 350 men and perhaps 10 tanks and tank destroyers. Ammunition had been expended liberally, and stocks at firing batteries were rather low. Expecting a renewed attack on the following day, Bayerlein requested and received 200 replacements from the regiments of the 275th Division assembled behind him. He also withdrew the bulk of his outpost line to locations south of the Périers-St. Lô highway, leaving only very lightly manned positions north of the road, where he anticipated strong American artillery fire. 39"

When Kluge learned the Allies had bombed front-line positions, he thought immediately the strike must have occurred in the Panzer Group West sector, for that was the area he considered of primary importance to the integrity of the entire Normandy front. He lost no time in telephoning Eberbach and asking in alarm what had happened. Nothing new, Eberbach replied; everything very quiet. 40 Discovering that it was Panzer Lehr in the Seventh Army sector that had been bombed, Kluge telephoned Hausser and asked for \"a quick run-down on the situation.\" Hausser complied. He began a calm recital of facts. \"Strong fire and patrol activity on the right wing; artillery fire on the Vire bridges; reorganization of the [American] army front.\" \"Reorganization for what?\" Kluge interrupted. \"To insert another corps,\" Hausser explained. Then after waiting a moment, he continued. \"On the left flank very strong air activity; attacks in the form of bomb carpets three kilometers behind the MLR. Attack against the middle of the left sector. Only limited attacks; no concerted assault recognizable.\" \"In other words,\" Kluge pressed for an interpretation, \"as weather improves we can expect increasingly severe fighting around St. Lô and westward. Isn't that about it?\" Hausser agreed. \"On the extreme left wing also,\" he added. \"I'd like to ask you again,\" Kluge insisted, \"do you get the impression that you're heading for heavy fighting?\" \"We've got to expect it somewhere,\" Hausser allowed. He revealed little concern or worry. \"Have you created appropriate reserves?\" Kluge asked. Hausser reminded him that the 353d Division had been pulled out of the line. But Kluge seemed already to be thinking of something else. \"Without any doubt,\" he said, as though talking to himself, \"there's something new in all this air activity. We have got to expect a heavy enemy offensive somewhere.\" 41"

Not yet sealed off, the hole was inhabited by isolated units, by bewildered individuals, and by departed souls. The 353d Division and the remainder of the 275th Division had been committed, but it was highly questionable whether they could restore the front or even re-establish a defensive line. Kluge nevertheless felt there was still hope of stopping the Americans. Although \"we must fight for every yard on the right wing [Panzer Group West sector],\" Kluge stated, he had freedom of movement and of withdrawal on the left, west of the Vire. If he could decrease the length of his line west of St. Lô by withdrawal and thereby extricate the 2d SS Panzer Division and use it as a mobile reserve, he might salvage something from the discouraging situation, but he needed \"a free hand in his decisions about Seventh Army.\" Would Hitler give him a free hand? Shortly after midnight, Hitler said he would. 47"
