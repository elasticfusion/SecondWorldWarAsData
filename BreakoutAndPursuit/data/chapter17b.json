        "Paragraph_1": "How had it happened? How had an operation designed to reach the Coutances-Caumont line been parlayed from a breakthrough into a breakout? The explanation could be likened to a double exposure of the same subject, filmed from different points of view. The edges of the picture were slightly blurred, but the result was clearly discernible. The Germans had astutely escaped the initial COBRA thrusts, only to fall prey to the later developments. They had been completely surprised by the COBRA bombardment and ground attack of 25 July. And yet they themselves had aggravated the consequences. That they had been outmaneuvered was soon apparent. Their communications facilities wrecked, they had found their endeavors to re-establish order marked by ignorance and inevitable frustration. Unable to keep abreast of a COBRA operation that developed remarkable speed after a slow beginning, the Germans were too late in their counter-measures. Hampered by shortages of manpower, equipment, and supplies, they were also the victims of their own mistakes. Whereas Eberbach had launched major portions of two panzer divisions in a counterattack several hours after GOODWOOD had begun and had thereby blocked British exploitation of a penetration already achieved, the Germans in the Cotentin were not able to match or even come close to Eberbach's accomplishment. A large part of the confusing and conflicting drama that had ensued in the Cotentin could in the final analysis be traced to the failure of a few men to react quickly, with decision, and in accord with a single purpose."

From the night of 13 July, when American pressure against the LXXXIV Corps left began to diminish, Hausser was increasingly free to regroup his forces because except for minor action the fighting in the Cotentin came to an end with the fall of St. Lô on 18 July. A week of poor weather conditions before COBRA gave Hausser further respite. In all, he had about ten days to reshuffle his forces in the Cotentin. The equivalent of nearly seven infantry divisions, these forces had numbered about 21,000 combat effectives. The infantry was incapable of rapid movement, but Hausser had two panzer divisions that were highly mobile. Even though Panzer Lehr had not been at top strength (it had been unable--even with the support of its attached parachute regiment--to launch an attack east of the Vire River to regain St. Lô), the 2d SS Panzer Division had been strong, confident, and aggressive."

The 2d SS Panzer Division, though more fortunate than Lehr in escaping bombardment, could not be extricated from the front in time for a decisive counterattack role. Once the Americans broke through, their mechanized and motorized troops easily outmaneuvered German infantrymen and paratroopers who comprised Hausser's immediate reserves, forces that were sadly deficient in transportation facilities. Without additional assembled reserves, Hausser could not close the gap that developed between the LXXXIV and II Parachute Corps."

Afraid to appear a defeatist in Hausser's eyes, Choltitz did not tell him of the alternate positions. The relationship between the two commanders was founded on a lack of mutual trust, co-operation, and understanding that bred confusion. When Choltitz had marked a line of defense to the rear, he had been responsible for the defense of the Cotentin from the west coast to the Vire River. After the fall of St. Lô, when the 352d Division withdrew behind the Vire River west of St. Lô and took positions on the west bank, Hausser allowed it to remain under the control of the II Parachute Corps. Thus, when Choltitz shortly after the COBRA bombardment ordered Panzer Lehr to man a designated line to the rear, the consequence was that Lehr had neither contact with the 352d nor an anchor on the Vire River. Both units had floating flanks. When the 352d withdrew a day later to anchor the flanks, Panzer Lehr had been further jostled by the COBRA exploitation and was beyond salvation."

When Pemsel assured Kluge on 28 July that strong rear-guard action north of Coutances would keep the Americans out of the city and prevent them from launching a major effort along the coast, Kluge was certain that Hausser understood the significance of Coutances--that loss of Coutances would open the door to an American drive that might outflank the counterattack about to be launched in the army center by the XLVII Panzer Corps. His surprise bordered on shock when he received word that evening of Hausser's plan to have the LXXXIV Corps in the Coutances area escape American encirclement by attacking southeast, rather than by withdrawing south along the coast. By virtually abandoning Coutances and projecting a concentration of forces near Percy, Hausser removed opposition to an American advance down the west coast of the Cotentin."

German casualties were later conservatively estimated as 10 percent of the total troops in the area. Even more important than the casualties were the confusion, the disruption of communications, and the shock effect. Some German soldiers were still deaf twenty-four hours later. Despite the bomb casualties among American troops, despite the fact that small isolated German groups had still been able to resist after the bombing, the COBRA bombardment was later judged to have been the best example in the European theater of \"carpet bombing.\""

The German hold on the Cotentin west coast broken and the way thereby open not only to an encirclement of the LXXXIV Corps left but also to the much more serious encirclement of the entire German defensive line in France, the Americans again acted with dispatch."

There is no doubt that General Montgomery had worried Kluge in the Caen sector. By creating uncertainty in the mind of the German field commander, Montgomery had added to and deepened the surprise that accompanied the American operation. Except for two armored divisions that had moved to the American zone to oppose the post-COBRA exploitation, Montgomery had tied down the strength of Panzer Group West, which still guarded the vital approaches to Falaise. Whether General Montgomery had visualized it so, or whether he was aware of the historical example, the breakout in Normandy from a larger perspective resembled in the essentials of maneuver the operation in Sicily of less than a year earlier. There, too, Montgomery's forces had tied down the enemy while Patton's U.S. troops carried the main assault and made the striking gain."
